# Canvas API

Baseline

Widely available

This feature is well established and works across many devices and browser versions. It’s been available across browsers since July 2015.

The **Canvas API** provides a means for drawing graphics via JavaScript and the HTML `<canvas>` element. Among other things, it can be used for animation, game graphics, data visualization, photo manipulation, and real-time video processing.

The Canvas API largely focuses on 2D graphics. The WebGL API, which also uses the `<canvas>` element, draws hardware-accelerated 2D and 3D graphics.

## Basic example

This simple example draws a green rectangle onto a canvas.

### HTML

```html
<canvas id="canvas"></canvas>
```

### JavaScript

The `Document.getElementById()` method gets a reference to the HTML `<canvas>` element. Next, the `HTMLCanvasElement.getContext()` method gets that element's context—the thing onto which the drawing will be rendered.

The actual drawing is done using the `CanvasRenderingContext2D` interface. The `fillStyle` property makes the rectangle green. The `fillRect()` method places its top-left corner at (10, 10), and gives it a size of 150 units wide by 100 tall.

```js
const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

ctx.fillStyle = "green";
ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 100);
```

### Result

## Reference

- `HTMLCanvasElement`
- `CanvasRenderingContext2D`
- `CanvasGradient`
- `CanvasPattern`
- `ImageBitmap`
- `ImageData`
- `TextMetrics`
- `OffscreenCanvas`
- `Path2D`
- `ImageBitmapRenderingContext`

**Note:** The interfaces related to the `WebGLRenderingContext` are referenced under WebGL.

**Note:** `OffscreenCanvas` is also available in web workers.

`CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack` is a related interface.
