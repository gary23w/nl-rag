## Creating a chart

Charts are composed of at least one series of one or more data points. Series themselves are comprised of references to cell ranges.

```
>>> from openpyxl import Workbook
>>> wb = Workbook()
>>> ws = wb.active
>>> for i in range(10):
...     ws.append([i])
>>>
>>> from openpyxl.chart import BarChart, Reference, Series
>>> values = Reference(ws, min_col=1, min_row=1, max_col=1, max_row=10)
>>> chart = BarChart()
>>> chart.add_data(values)
>>> ws.add_chart(chart, "E15")
>>> wb.save("SampleChart.xlsx")
```

By default the top-left corner of a chart is anchored to cell E15 and the size is 15 x 7.5 cm (approximately 5 columns by 14 rows). This can be changed by setting the *anchor*, *width* and *height* properties of the chart. The actual size will depend on operating system and device. Other anchors are possible; see `openpyxl.drawing.spreadsheet_drawing` for further information.
