Limited availability

This feature is not Baseline because it does not work in some of the most widely-used browsers.

**Experimental:** **This is an experimental technology** Check the Browser compatibility table carefully before using this in production.

**Note:** This feature is available in Web Workers, except for Shared Web Workers.

A Human Interface Device (HID) is a type of device that takes input from or provides output to humans. It also refers to the HID protocol, a standard for bi-directional communication between a host and a device that is designed to simplify the installation procedure. The HID protocol was originally developed for USB devices but has since been implemented over many other protocols, including Bluetooth.

## Interfaces

**`HID`**

Provides methods for connecting to HID devices, listing attached HID devices and event handlers for connected HID devices.

**`HIDDevice`**

Represents an HID device. It's possible for a single physical device to be represented by multiple `HIDDevice` objects.

**`HIDInputReportEvent`**

Passed to the `HIDDevice` `inputreport` event when an input report is received from any associated HID device.

**`HIDConnectionEvent`**

Passed to `HID` `connect` and `disconnect` events when a device is connected or disconnected.

## Examples

You can connect to a device with the `requestDevice()` method. In this case, we select from all the available devices.

```js
const device = await navigator.hid.requestDevice({ filters: [] });
// A popup titled `... wants to connect to a HID Device` with `Cancel` and `Connect` buttons will show up with a device list to select from.
// Select one and click on `Connect` button. Then the device will be an array with the selected device in it.
```

We can retrieve all the devices the website has been granted access to previously and log the device names to the console.

```js
let devices = await navigator.hid.getDevices();
devices.forEach((device) => {
  console.log(`HID: ${device.productName}`);
});
```

We can register event listeners for disconnection of any HID devices.

```js
navigator.hid.addEventListener("disconnect", (event) => {
  console.log(`HID disconnected: ${event.device.productName}`);
  console.dir(event);
});
// For example, when my connected keyboard gets disconnected, the log in the console will show:
// HID disconnected: USB Keyboard
// {
//    bubbles: false
//    cancelBubble: false
//    cancelable: false
//    composed: false
//    currentTarget: HID {onconnect: null, ondisconnect: null}
//    defaultPrevented: false
//    device: HIDDevice {oninputreport: null, opened: false, vendorId: 6700, productId: 11555, productName: "USB Keyboard", …}
//    eventPhase: 0
//    isTrusted: true
//    path: []
//    returnValue: true
//    srcElement: HID {onconnect: null, ondisconnect: null}
//    target: HID {onconnect: null, ondisconnect: null}
//    timeStamp: 18176.600000023842
//    type: "disconnect"
// }

// The event above is an instance of the HIDConnectionEvent interface.
