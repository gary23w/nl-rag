## Common problems

Regular expressions are a powerful tool for some applications, but in some ways their behaviour isn’t intuitive and at times they don’t behave the way you may expect them to. This section will point out some of the most common pitfalls.

### Use string methods

Sometimes using the `re` module is a mistake. If you’re matching a fixed string, or a single character class, and you’re not using any `re` features such as the `IGNORECASE` flag, then the full power of regular expressions may not be required. Strings have several methods for performing operations with fixed strings and they’re usually much faster, because the implementation is a single small C loop that’s been optimized for the purpose, instead of the large, more generalized regular expression engine.

One example might be replacing a single fixed string with another one; for example, you might replace `word` with `deed`. `re.sub()` seems like the function to use for this, but consider the `replace()` method. Note that `replace()` will also replace `word` inside words, turning `swordfish` into `sdeedfish`, but the naive RE `word` would have done that, too. (To avoid performing the substitution on parts of words, the pattern would have to be `\bword\b`, in order to require that `word` have a word boundary on either side. This takes the job beyond `replace()`’s abilities.)

Another common task is deleting every occurrence of a single character from a string or replacing it with another single character. You might do this with something like `re.sub('\n', ' ', S)`, but `translate()` is capable of doing both tasks and will be faster than any regular expression operation can be.

In short, before turning to the `re` module, consider whether your problem can be solved with a faster and simpler string method.

### Greedy versus non-greedy

When repeating a regular expression, as in `a*`, the resulting action is to consume as much of the pattern as possible. This fact often bites you when you’re trying to match a pair of balanced delimiters, such as the angle brackets surrounding an HTML tag. The naive pattern for matching a single HTML tag doesn’t work because of the greedy nature of `.*`.

```python3
>>> s = '<html><head><title>Title</title>'
>>> len(s)
32
>>> print(re.match('<.*>', s).span())
(0, 32)
>>> print(re.match('<.*>', s).group())
<html><head><title>Title</title>
```

The RE matches the `'<'` in `'<html>'`, and the `.*` consumes the rest of the string. There’s still more left in the RE, though, and the `>` can’t match at the end of the string, so the regular expression engine has to backtrack character by character until it finds a match for the `>`. The final match extends from the `'<'` in `'<html>'` to the `'>'` in `'</title>'`, which isn’t what you want.

In this case, the solution is to use the non-greedy quantifiers `*?`, `+?`, `??`, or `{m,n}?`, which match as *little* text as possible. In the above example, the `'>'` is tried immediately after the first `'<'` matches, and when it fails, the engine advances a character at a time, retrying the `'>'` at every step. This produces just the right result:

```python3
>>> print(re.match('<.*?>', s).group())
<html>
```

(Note that parsing HTML or XML with regular expressions is painful. Quick-and-dirty patterns will handle common cases, but HTML and XML have special cases that will break the obvious regular expression; by the time you’ve written a regular expression that handles all of the possible cases, the patterns will be *very* complicated. Use an HTML or XML parser module for such tasks.)

### Using re.VERBOSE

By now you’ve probably noticed that regular expressions are a very compact notation, but they’re not terribly readable. REs of moderate complexity can become lengthy collections of backslashes, parentheses, and metacharacters, making them difficult to read and understand.

For such REs, specifying the `re.VERBOSE` flag when compiling the regular expression can be helpful, because it allows you to format the regular expression more clearly.

The `re.VERBOSE` flag has several effects. Whitespace in the regular expression that *isn’t* inside a character class is ignored. This means that an expression such as `dog | cat` is equivalent to the less readable `dog|cat`, but `[a b]` will still match the characters `'a'`, `'b'`, or a space. In addition, you can also put comments inside a RE; comments extend from a `#` character to the next newline. When used with triple-quoted strings, this enables REs to be formatted more neatly:

```python3
pat = re.compile(r"""
 \s*                 # Skip leading whitespace
 (?P<header>[^:]+)   # Header name
 \s* :               # Whitespace, and a colon
 (?P<value>.*?)      # The header's value -- *? used to
                     # lose the following trailing whitespace
 \s*$                # Trailing whitespace to end-of-line
""", re.VERBOSE)
```

This is far more readable than:

```python3
pat = re.compile(r"\s*(?P<header>[^:]+)\s*:(?P<value>.*?)\s*$")
```
