# Navigator: requestMIDIAccess() method

Limited availability

This feature is not Baseline because it does not work in some of the most widely-used browsers.

**Secure context:** This feature is available only in secure contexts (HTTPS), in some or all supporting browsers.

The **`requestMIDIAccess()`** method of the `Navigator` interface returns a `Promise` representing a request for access to MIDI devices on a user's system. This method is part of the Web MIDI API, which provides a means for accessing, enumerating, and manipulating MIDI devices.

This method may prompt the user for access to MIDI devices available to their system, or it may use a previously established preference to grant or deny access. If permission is granted then the `Promise` resolves and a `MIDIAccess` object is returned.

## Syntax

```js
requestMIDIAccess()
requestMIDIAccess(MIDIOptions)
```

### Parameters

**`MIDIOptions` Optional**

An `Object` representing options to pass into the method. These options are:

**`sysex`**

A `Boolean` value that, if set to `true`, allows the ability to send and receive system exclusive (sysex) messages. The default value is `false`.

**`software`**

A `Boolean` value that, if set to `true`, allows the system to utilize any installed software synthesizers. The default value is `false`.

### Return value

A `Promise` that resolves with a `MIDIAccess` object.

### Exceptions

**`AbortError` `DOMException`**

Thrown if the document or page is closed due to user navigation.

**`InvalidStateError` `DOMException`**

Thrown if the underlying system raises any errors.

**`NotSupportedError` `DOMException`**

Thrown if the feature or options are not supported by the system.

**`NotAllowedError` `DOMException`**

Thrown if the user or system denies the application from creating a MIDIAccess object with the requested options, or if the document is not allowed to use the feature (for example, because of a Permission Policy, or because the user previously denied a permission request).

## Security requirements

Access to the API is subject to the following constraints:

- The method must be called in a secure context.
- Access may be gated by the `midi` HTTP Permission Policy.
- The user must explicitly grant permission to use the API though a user-agent specific mechanism, or have previously granted permission. Note that if access is denied by a permission policy it cannot be granted by a user permission.

The permission status can be queried using the Permissions API method `navigator.permissions.query()`, passing a permission descriptor with the `midi` permission and (optional) `sysex` property:

```js
navigator.permissions.query({ name: "midi", sysex: true }).then((result) => {
  if (result.state === "granted") {
    // Access granted.
  } else if (result.state === "prompt") {
    // Using API will prompt for permission
  }
  // Permission was denied by user prompt or permission policy
});
```

## Examples

### Request MIDI access

In the following example, the `Navigator.requestMIDIAccess()` method returns the `MIDIAccess` object, which gives access to information about the input and output MIDI ports.

```js
navigator.requestMIDIAccess().then((access) => {
  // Get lists of available MIDI controllers
  const inputs = access.inputs.values();
  const outputs = access.outputs.values();
  // …
});
```
