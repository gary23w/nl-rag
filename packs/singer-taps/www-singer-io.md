### The open-source standard for writing scripts that move data.

Singer describes how data extraction scripts—called “taps” —and data loading scripts—called “targets”— should communicate, allowing them to be used in any combination to move data from any source to any destination. Send data between databases, web APIs, files, queues, and just about anything else you can think of.

#### Try it

For example, these two simple commands pull currency exchange rate data from Exchangeratesapi.io into a CSV file:

```
          › pip install target-csv tap-exchangeratesapi
          › tap-exchangeratesapi | target-csv
              INFO Replicating the latest exchange rate data from exchangeratesapi.io
              INFO Tap exiting normally
          › cat exchange_rate.csv

### Features

- Unix-inspired Singer taps and targets are simple applications composed with pipes—no daemons or complicated plugins needed.
- JSON-based Singer applications communicate with JSON, making them easy to work with and implement in any programming language. Singer also supports JSON Schema to provide rich data types and rigid structure when needed.
- Efficient Singer makes it easy to maintain state between invocations to support incremental extraction.

### Singer Taps

**Taps** extract data from any source and write it to a standard stream in a JSON-based format.

### Singer Targets

**Targets** consume data from taps and do something with it, like load it into a file, API or database.
