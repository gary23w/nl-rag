# Fetch API

The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). It is a more powerful and flexible replacement for `XMLHttpRequest`.

## Concepts and usage

The Fetch API uses `Request` and `Response` objects (and other things involved with network requests), as well as related concepts such as CORS and the HTTP Origin header semantics.

For making a request and fetching a resource, use the `fetch()` method. It is a global method in both `Window` and `Worker` contexts. This makes it available in pretty much any context you might want to fetch resources in.

The `fetch()` method takes one mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch. It returns a `Promise` that resolves to the `Response` to that request — as soon as the server responds with headers — **even if the server response is an HTTP error status**. You can also optionally pass in an `init` options object as the second argument (see `Request`).

Once a `Response` is retrieved, there are a number of methods available to define what the body content is and how it should be handled.

You can create a request and response directly using the `Request()` and `Response()` constructors, but it's uncommon to do this directly. Instead, these are more likely to be created as results of other API actions (for example, `FetchEvent.respondWith()` from service workers).

### Deferred Fetch

The `fetchLater()` API enables a developer to request a *deferred fetch*, that can be sent after a specified period of time, or when the page is closed or navigated away from. See Using Deferred Fetch.

## Interfaces

**`Window.fetch()` and `WorkerGlobalScope.fetch()`**

The `fetch()` method used to fetch a resource.

**`Window.fetchLater()`**

Used to make a deferred fetch request.

**`DeferredRequestInit`**

Represents the set of options that can be used to configure a deferred fetch request.

**`FetchLaterResult`**

Represents the result of requesting a deferred fetch.

**`Headers`**

Represents response/request headers, allowing you to query them and take different actions depending on the results.

**`Request`**

Represents a resource request.

**`Response`**

Represents the response to a request.

## HTTP headers

**`deferred-fetch`**

Controls the top-level quota for the `fetchLater()` API.

**`deferred-fetch-minimal`**

Controls the shared cross-origin subframe quota for the `fetchLater()` API.
