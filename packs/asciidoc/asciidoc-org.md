# Publish presentation-rich content from a concise and comprehensive authoring format.

AsciiDoc is a plain text markup language for writing technical content. It’s packed with semantic elements and equipped with features to modularize and reuse content. AsciiDoc content can be composed using a text editor, managed in a version control system, and published to multiple output formats.

### Experience the magic of a lightweight markup language

When you write in AsciiDoc, you use plain text. That means the bulk of what you type are the words you want to communicate. You only add markup characters when you need to encode meaning that can’t otherwise be inferred. For example, a section title starts with a series of equals signs and an unordered list item begins with one or more asterisks. Try writing AsciiDoc in the editor below to see for yourself!

== Section Title

* A list item
* Another list item

[,ruby]
----
puts 'Hello, World!'
----
```

## How AsciiDoc stacks up

### Compare AsciiDoc to other markup languages

AsciiDoc is designed to strike a balance between systematic, machine-oriented syntax and natural language. This design affords AsciiDoc the ability to capture and encode nearly all the semantics of a highly-structured language while still being readable in source form.

DocBook is an **XML schema** for writing books and manuals about technical subjects. It has an extensive catalog of tags for denoting content structures and elements. Although **well-supported by tools**, writing in DocBook is tedious because the **content is overshadowed** by the markup, there are **a lot of tags** to remember, and **XML indentation** can be a major distraction.

#### AsciiDoc

- index.adoc
- chapter-1.adoc
- chapter-2.adoc

```asciidoc
= Book Title
Doc Writer <doc@example.org>
v2.0.1, 2022-01-15
:doctype: book
:front-cover-image: cover.png[,1050,1600]

[preface]
== Preface

The story behind the story.

include::chapter-1.adoc[leveloffset=1]

include::chapter-2.adoc[leveloffset=1]
```

```asciidoc
= Chapter Title

A paragraph with *bold* and _italic_ text.

.Image title
image::an-image.jpg[align=center]

The `xref` macro is used for source-to-source links, like xref:a-book.adoc[].
An external link to https://eclipse.org[Eclipse].

NOTE: One of five built-in admonition block types.
```

```asciidoc
= Another Chapter Title

 Text indented by one space is preformatted.

The following source code block contains a Ruby function named `hello` that prints "`Hello, World!`".

[%linenums,ruby]
----
def hello name = 'World'
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end
----

That's all she wrote!
```

**Content is the central focus** in AsciiDoc. The document starts off with **no ceremonial prologue**, much of the structure is inferred from its **line-oriented** arrangement, there’s **no indentation** needed, and content is marked up with **shorthand notations** instead of XML tags. And yet, you can still produce DocBook from AsciiDoc to tie into existing toolchains.

#### Markdown

- index.md

````markdown
# Heading 1

A paragraph with **bold** and *italic* text.
A link to [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org).
A reusable link to [GitLab](gitlab).

![An image](an-image.png)

## Heading 2

* Unordered list item
  * Nest items by aligning marker with text of parent item
* Another unordered list item

**NOTE:** An admonition can be emulated using a bold label.

### Heading 3

    Text indented by four spaces is preformatted.

A code block with a Ruby function named `hello` that prints “Hello, World!”:

```ruby
def hello name = 'World'
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end
```

````

Markdown is a **lightweight** markup language for producing HTML. Markdown builds on basic **plain text conventions** for formatting content. While approachable to a broad audience, it **stops short** of being a technical writing language. The need for **syntax extensions** quickly enters the picture. In reality, Markdown is the basis for a variety of markup languages that often **deviate widely**.

#### AsciiDoc

- index.adoc

```asciidoc
= Document Title
:toc:
:url-gitlab: https://gitlab.eclipse.org

A paragraph with *bold* and _italic_ text.
A link to https://eclipse.org[Eclipse].
A reusable link to {url-gitlab}[GitLab].

== Section title

* Unordered list item
** Add another marker to make a nested item
* Another unordered list item

NOTE: One of five built-in admonition block types.

=== Subsection title

 Text indented by one space is preformatted.

A source block with a Ruby function named `hello` that prints "`Hello, World!`":

[,ruby]
----
def hello name = 'World'
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end
----
```

AsciiDoc appears **strikingly similar** to Markdown, making way for an easy transition. Where AsciiDoc shines is in **its depth**. AsciiDoc provides all the essential elements in **technical writing** out of the box. **No variants** needed. Its syntax can be elaborated without having to fundamentally change the language, assuring users that it’s still **standard AsciiDoc**.

DITA is an **XML schema** for representing a broad range of information. Its architecture encourages **content modularity** and reuse, **portable references**, and **controlled extension** of its vocabulary. These goals are met using a **complex system** of XML tags, concepts, and toolchains. DITA’s complexity means it has a substantial learning curve and is **sparsely supported**.

#### AsciiDoc

- index.adoc

```asciidoc
= Topic Title
:description: A brief description of topic.

== Section title

A paragraph with *bold* and _italic_ text.

.Image title

The `xref` macro is used for source-to-source links, like xref:a-topic.adoc[].
An external link to https://eclipse.org[Eclipse].

 Text indented by one space is preformatted.

The following source code block contains a Ruby function named `hello` that prints "`Hello, World!`".

[,ruby]
----
def hello name = 'World'
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end
----

=== Subsection title

AsciiDoc supports nested sections.
```

AsciiDoc fits the same architectural goals into an **XML-free** package and is **widely supported**. Documents can be partitioned into **units of content** and reused with the include directive. Document references are defined **source-to-source** and translated into links between published files. Syntax extensions invite **new markup and integrations** while keeping the language consistent.

Sub-subsection title
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  Preformatted text must be indented by two spaces and follow a text block that ends with the :: marker.

The following source code block contains a Ruby function named ``hello`` that prints "Hello, World!".

.. code-block:: ruby

   def hello name = 'World'
     puts "Hello, #{name}!"
   end

.. _GitLab: https://gitlab.eclipse.org
```

reStructuredText is **plain text markup** for use in docstrings and formal documentation. It offers an extensible syntax for producing structured output. It’s **line-oriented** design keeps the content clear and the separation of blocks evident. However, its reliance on **indentation**, non-traditional notation, and **syntax variations** make the language **esoteric** and hard for newcomers to grasp.

==== Sub-subsection title

 Text indented by one space is preformatted.

The following source code block contains a Ruby function named `hello` that prints "`Hello, World!`".

[,ruby]
----
def hello name = 'World'
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end
----
```

AsciiDoc aims to provide an **easy-to-read**, what-you-see-is-what-you-get syntax. It attains this goal by making most **indentation insignificant**, using clear block boundaries, and relying on **conventional notation**. AsciiDoc is composed of **a few patterns**, such as delimited blocks, macros, and formatting pairs. A newcomer can pick up the syntax mostly by intuition alone.

As the most basic **building block** of the web, HTML gives structure to **web content**. But it also assumes a lot of **presentation responsibilities**. It’s rare to find an HTML document focused solely on content. Its forte is in assembling **high fidelity web pages**, not as a technical writing format. It has all the **ceremony of XML** with only a fraction of its presentation-agnostic semantics.

Although AsciiDoc was initially conceived as a DocBook shorthand, it’s now mostly used to **generate HTML**. By producing the HTML, content is **not impacted by redesigns** and **content variations**, like slides or eBooks, can be created from the same source. AsciiDoc processors bundle a **stylesheet** that requires **no web development** to achieve a professional look.

## Specification process

### Governed by a language specification, always evolving

The AsciiDoc Language specification was launched to ensure that AsciiDoc continues to evolve and that it’s processed consistently by implementations across language runtimes, authoring environments, and application integrations. The specification is managed and governed by the AsciiDoc Language project and, at a higher level, by the AsciiDoc Working Group at the Eclipse Foundation. Development of the specification is currently underway.
