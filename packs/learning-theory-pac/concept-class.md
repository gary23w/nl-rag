# Concept class

In computational learning theory in mathematics, a **concept** over a domain *X* is a total Boolean function over *X*. A **concept class** is a class of concepts. Concept classes are a subject of computational learning theory.

Concept class terminology frequently appears in model theory associated with probably approximately correct (PAC) learning. In this setting, if one takes a set *Y* as a set of (classifier output) labels, and *X* is a set of examples, the map $c:X\to Y$ , i.e. from examples to classifier labels (where $Y=\{0,1\}$ and where *c* is a subset of *X*), *c* is then said to be a *concept*. A *concept class* C is then a collection of such concepts.

Given a class of concepts *C*, a subclass *D* is **reachable** if there exists a sample *s* such that *D* contains exactly those concepts in *C* that are extensions to *s*. Not every subclass is reachable.

## Background

A *sample* s is a partial function from X to $\{0,1\}$ . Identifying a concept with its characteristic function mapping X to $\{0,1\}$ , it is a special case of a sample.

Two samples are *consistent* if they agree on the intersection of their domains. A sample $s'$ *extends* another sample s if the two are consistent and the domain of s is contained in the domain of $s'$ .

## Examples

Suppose that $C=S^{+}(X)$ . Then:

- the subclass $\{\{x\}\}$ is reachable with the sample $s=\{(x,1)\}$ ;
- the subclass $S^{+}(Y)$ for $Y\subseteq X$ are reachable with a sample that maps the elements of $X-Y$ to zero;
- the subclass $S(X)$ , which consists of the singleton sets, is *not* reachable.

## Applications

Let C be some concept class. For any concept $c\in C$ , we call this concept $1/d$ *-good* for a positive integer d if, for all $x\in X$ , at least $1/d$ of the concepts in C agree with c on the classification of x . The *fingerprint dimension* $FD(C)$ of the entire concept class C is the least positive integer d such that every reachable subclass $C'\subseteq C$ contains a concept that is $1/d$ -good for it. This quantity can be used to bound the minimum number of equivalence queries needed to learn a class of concepts according to the following inequality: ${\textstyle FD(C)-1\leq \#EQ(C)\leq \lceil FD(C)\ln(|C|)\rceil }$ .
