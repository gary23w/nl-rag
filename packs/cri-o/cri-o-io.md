### Distribution Packaging

## Project Layout

CRI-O uses the same basic layout in OBS as Kubernetes project `isv:kubernetes`, but lives in a dedicated umbrella project called `isv:cri-o`.

This project contains a bunch of other subprojects.

### Important Notice

We switched from `https://pkgs.k8s.io/addons:/cri-o` to a new subproject `https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/isv:/cri-o` to work independently from the pkgs.k8s.io CDN. Please switch over if you haven’t already (see the examples below).

- Stable Versions
- Prereleases

All packages are based on the static binary bundles provided by the CRI-O CI.

#### Define the Kubernetes version and used CRI-O stream

```bash
KUBERNETES_VERSION=v1.32
CRIO_VERSION=v1.32
```

#### Distributions using `rpm` packages

##### Add the Kubernetes repository

```bash
cat <<EOF | tee /etc/yum.repos.d/kubernetes.repo
[kubernetes]
name=Kubernetes
baseurl=https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/$KUBERNETES_VERSION/rpm/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/$KUBERNETES_VERSION/rpm/repodata/repomd.xml.key
EOF
```

##### Add the CRI-O repository

```bash
cat <<EOF | tee /etc/yum.repos.d/cri-o.repo
[cri-o]
name=CRI-O
baseurl=https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/isv:/cri-o:/stable:/$CRIO_VERSION/rpm/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/isv:/cri-o:/stable:/$CRIO_VERSION/rpm/repodata/repomd.xml.key
EOF
```

##### Install package dependencies from the official repositories

```bash
dnf install -y container-selinux
```

##### Install the packages

```bash
dnf install -y cri-o kubelet kubeadm kubectl
```

##### Start CRI-O

```bash
systemctl start crio.service
```

##### Bootstrap a cluster

```bash
swapoff -a
modprobe br_netfilter
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

kubeadm init
```

#### Distributions using `deb` packages

##### Install the dependencies for adding repositories

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y software-properties-common curl
```

##### Add the Kubernetes repository

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/$KUBERNETES_VERSION/deb/Release.key |
    gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/$KUBERNETES_VERSION/deb/ /" |
    tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
```

##### Add the CRI-O repository

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/isv:/cri-o:/stable:/$CRIO_VERSION/deb/Release.key |
    gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/cri-o-apt-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/cri-o-apt-keyring.gpg] https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/isv:/cri-o:/stable:/$CRIO_VERSION/deb/ /" |
    tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cri-o.list
```

##### Install the packages

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y cri-o kubelet kubeadm kubectl
```

##### Start CRI-O

```bash
systemctl start crio.service
```

##### Bootstrap a cluster

```bash
swapoff -a
modprobe br_netfilter
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

kubeadm init
```

#### `Fedora`

Alternatively, the packages are available in the Fedora packaging system. As of Fedora 40 and later, CRI-O now only packages one version per version of fedora. These correspond to the version of the kubernetes, cri-tools, and golang packages.

```shell
dnf install cri-o
```

### CRI-O Running Kubernetes Pods

## What is CRI-O?

CRI-O is an implementation of the Kubernetes CRI (Container Runtime Interface) to enable using OCI (Open Container Initiative) compatible runtimes. It is a lightweight alternative to using Docker as the runtime for kubernetes. It allows Kubernetes to use any OCI-compliant runtime as the container runtime for running pods. Today it supports runc and Kata Containers as the container runtimes but any OCI-conformant runtime can be plugged in principle.

CRI-O supports OCI container images and can pull from any container registry. It is a lightweight alternative to using Docker, Moby or rkt as the runtime for Kubernetes.

CRI-O is developed by maintainers and contributors from these companies and others. It is a community-driven, open source project. Feedback, users, and of course, contributors, are always welcome via the cri-o/cri-o GitHub project.

## Architecture

(CRI-O architecture)

The architectural components are as follows:

- Kubernetes contacts the kubelet to launch a pod.
  - Pods are a kubernetes concept consisting of one or more containers sharing the same IPC, NET and PID `namespaces` and living in the same cgroup.
- The kubelet forwards the request to the CRI-O daemon VIA kubernetes CRI (Container runtime interface) to launch the new POD.
- CRI-O uses the `containers/image` library to pull the image from a container registry.
- The downloaded image is unpacked into the container’s root filesystems, stored in COW file systems, using containers/storage library.
- After the rootfs has been created for the container, CRI-O generates an OCI runtime specification json file describing how to run the container using the OCI Generate tools.
- CRI-O then launches an OCI Compatible Runtime using the specification to run the container proceses. The default OCI Runtime is runc.
- Each container is monitored by a separate `conmon` process. The conmon process holds the `pty` of the PID1 of the container process. It handles logging for the container and records the exit code for the container process.
- Networking for the pod is setup through use of CNI, so any CNI plugin can be used with CRI-O.

## Components

CRI-O is made up of several components that are found in different GitHub repositories.

- OCI compatible runtime
- containers/storage
- containers/image
- networking (CNI)
- container monitoring (conmon)
- security is provided by several core Linux capabilities

### OCI compatible runtimes

CRI-O supports any OCI compatible runtime. We test with runc and Clear Containers today.

### Storage

The containers/storage library is used for managing layers and creating root file-systems for the containers in a pod: `Overlayfs`, `devicemapper`, `AUFS` and `btrfs` are implemented, with `Overlayfs` as the default driver.

Support for network based file system images (NFS, GlusterFS, CephFS) is on the development roadmap.

### Container images

The containers/image library is used for pulling images from registries. Currently, it supports Docker schema 2/version 1 as well as schema 2/version 2. It also passes all Docker and Kubernetes tests.

### Networking

The Container Network Interface CNI is used for setting up networking for the pods. Various CNI plugins such as Flannel, Weave and OpenShift-SDN have been tested with CRI-O and are working as expected.

### Monitoring

conmon is a utility within CRI-O that is used to monitor the containers, handle logging from the container process, serve attach clients and detects Out Of Memory (OOM) situations.

### Security

Container security separation policies are provided by a series of tools including SELinux, Capabilities, seccomp, and other security separation policies as specified in the OCI Specification.
