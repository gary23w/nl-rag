**Note:** This feature is available in Web Workers.

The **`URL`** interface is used to parse, construct, normalize, and encode URLs. It works by providing properties which allow you to easily read and modify the components of a URL.

You normally create a new `URL` object by specifying the URL as a string when calling its constructor, or by providing a relative URL and a base URL. You can then easily read the parsed components of the URL or make changes to the URL.

## Constructor

**`URL()`**

Creates and returns a `URL` object from a URL string and optional base URL string. Throws if the passed arguments don't define a valid URL.

## Instance properties

**`hash`**

A string containing a `'#'` followed by the fragment identifier of the URL.

**`host`**

A string containing the domain (that is the *hostname*) followed by (if a port was specified) a `':'` and the *port* of the URL.

**`hostname`**

A string containing the domain of the URL.

**`href`**

A stringifier that returns a string containing the whole URL.

**`origin` Read only**

Returns a string containing the origin of the URL, that is its scheme, its domain and its port.

**`password`**

A string containing the password specified before the domain name.

**`pathname`**

A string containing an initial `'/'` followed by the path of the URL, not including the query string or fragment.

**`port`**

A string containing the port number of the URL.

**`protocol`**

A string containing the protocol scheme of the URL, including the final `':'`.

A string indicating the URL's parameter string; if any parameters are provided, this string includes all of them, beginning with the leading `?` character.

**`searchParams` Read only**

A `URLSearchParams` object which can be used to access the individual query parameters found in `search`.

**`username`**

A string containing the username specified before the domain name.

## Static methods

**`canParse()`**

Returns a boolean indicating whether or not a URL defined from a URL string and optional base URL string is parsable and valid.

**`createObjectURL()`**

Returns a string containing a unique blob URL, that is a URL with `blob:` as its scheme, followed by an opaque string uniquely identifying the object in the browser.

**`parse()`**

Creates and returns a `URL` object from a URL string and optional base URL string, or returns `null` if the passed parameters define an invalid `URL`.

**`revokeObjectURL()`**

Revokes an object URL previously created using `URL.createObjectURL()`.

## Instance methods

**`toString()`**

Returns a string containing the whole URL. It is a synonym for `URL.href`, though it can't be used to modify the value.

**`toJSON()`**

Returns a string containing the whole URL. It returns the same string as the `href` property.

## Usage notes

The constructor takes a `url` parameter, and an optional `base` parameter to use as a base if the `url` parameter is a relative URL.

Note that in the case below "dogs" is the filename segment (because it has no trailing slash), and the relative URL "cats" is interpreted relative to the *directory* part of the base URL, which is `http://www.example.com/animals/`. See Resolving relative references to a URL for more information.

```js
const url = new URL("cats", "http://www.example.com/animals/dogs");
console.log(url.hostname); // "www.example.com"
console.log(url.pathname); // "/animals/cats"
```

The constructor will raise an exception if the URL cannot be parsed to a valid URL. You can either call the above code in a `try...catch` block or use the `canParse()` static method to first check the URL is valid:

```js
if (URL.canParse("cats", "http://www.example.com/animals/dogs")) {
  const url = new URL("cats", "http://www.example.com/animals/dogs");
  console.log(url.hostname); // "www.example.com"
  console.log(url.pathname); // "/animals/cats"
} else {
  console.log("Invalid URL");
}
```

URL properties can be set to construct the URL:

```js
url.hash = "tabby";
console.log(url.href); // "http://www.example.com/animals/cats#tabby"
```

URLs are encoded according to the rules found in RFC 3986. For instance:

```js
url.pathname = "démonstration.html";
console.log(url.href); // "http://www.example.com/d%C3%A9monstration.html"
```

The `URLSearchParams` interface can be used to build and manipulate the URL query string.

To get the search params from the current window's URL, you can do this:

```js
// https://some.site/?id=123
const parsedUrl = new URL(window.location.href);
console.log(parsedUrl.searchParams.get("id")); // "123"
```

The `toString()` method of `URL` just returns the value of the `href` property, so the constructor can be used to normalize and encode a URL directly.

```js
const response = await fetch(
  new URL("http://www.example.com/démonstration.html"),
);
```
