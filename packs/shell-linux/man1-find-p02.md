## EXPRESSION

The part of the command line after the list of starting points is
the expression.  This is a kind of query specification describing
how we match files and what we do with the files that were
matched.  An expression is composed of a sequence of things:

Tests  Tests return a true or false value, usually on the basis of
       some property of a file we are considering.  The -empty
       test for example is true only when the current file is
       empty.

Actions
       Actions have side effects (such as printing something on
       the standard output) and return either true or false,
       usually based on whether or not they are successful.  The
       -print action for example prints the name of the current
       file on the standard output.

Global options
       Global options affect the operation of tests and actions
       specified on any part of the command line.  Global options
       always return true.  The -depth option for example makes
       find traverse the file system in a depth-first order.

Positional options
       Positional options affect only tests or actions which
       follow them.  Positional options always return true.  The
       -regextype option for example is positional, specifying the
       regular expression dialect for regular expressions
       occurring later on the command line.

Operators
       Operators join together the other items within the
       expression.  They include for example -o (meaning logical
       OR) and -a (meaning logical AND).  Where an operator is
       missing, -a is assumed.

The -print action is performed on all files for which the whole
expression is true, unless it contains an action other than -prune
or -quit.  Actions which inhibit the default -print are -delete,
-exec, -execdir, -fls, -fprint, -fprint0, -fprintf, -ls, -ok,
-okdir, -print0, -printf and -print.

The -delete action also acts like an option (since it implies
-depth).

### POSITIONAL OPTIONS

Positional options always return true.  They affect only tests
occurring later on the command line.

-daystart
       Measure times (for -amin, -atime, -cmin, -ctime, -mmin, and
       -mtime) from the beginning of today rather than from 24
       hours ago.  This option only affects tests which appear
       later on the command line.

-follow
       Deprecated; use the -L option instead.  Dereference
       symbolic links.  Implies -noleaf.  The -follow option
       affects only those tests which appear after it on the
       command line.  Unless the -H or -L option has been
       specified, the position of the -follow option changes the
       behaviour of the -newer predicate; any files listed as the
       argument of -newer will be dereferenced if they are
       symbolic links.  The same consideration applies to
       -newerXY, -anewer and -cnewer.  Similarly, the -type
       predicate will always match against the type of the file
       that a symbolic link points to rather than the link itself.
       Using -follow causes the -lname and -ilname predicates
       always to return false.

-regextype type
       Changes the regular expression syntax understood by -regex
       and -iregex tests which occur later on the command line.
       To see which regular expression types are known, use
       -regextype help.  The Texinfo documentation (see SEE ALSO)
       explains the meaning of and differences between the various
       types of regular expression.  If you do not use this
       option, find behaves as if the regular expression type
       emacs had been specified.

-warn, -nowarn
       Turn warning messages on or off.  These warnings apply only
       to the command line usage, not to any conditions that find
       might encounter when it searches directories.  The default
       behaviour corresponds to -warn if standard input is a tty,
       and to -nowarn otherwise.  If a warning message relating to
       command-line usage is produced, the exit status of find is
       not affected.  If the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable
       is set, and -warn is also used, it is not specified which,
       if any, warnings will be active.

### GLOBAL OPTIONS

Global options always return true.  Global options take effect
even for tests which occur earlier on the command line.  To
prevent confusion, global options should be specified on the
command-line after the list of start points, just before the first
test, positional option or action.  If you specify a global option
in some other place, find will issue a warning message explaining
that this can be confusing.

The global options occur after the list of start points, and so
are not the same kind of option as -L, for example.

-d     A synonym for -depth, for compatibility with FreeBSD,
       NetBSD, MacOS X and OpenBSD.

-depth Process each directory's contents before the directory
       itself.  The -delete action also implies -depth.

-files0-from file
       Read the starting points from file instead of getting them
       on the command line.  In contrast to the known limitations
       of passing starting points via arguments on the command
       line, namely the limitation of the amount of file names,
       and the inherent ambiguity of file names clashing with
       option names, using this option allows to safely pass an
       arbitrary number of starting points to find.

       Using this option and passing starting points on the
       command line is mutually exclusive, and is therefore not
       allowed at the same time.

       The file argument is mandatory.  One can use -files0-from -
       to read the list of starting points from the standard input
       stream, and e.g. from a pipe.  In this case, the actions
       -ok and -okdir are not allowed, because they would
       obviously interfere with reading from standard input in
       order to get a user confirmation.

       The starting points in file have to be separated by ASCII
       NUL characters.  Two consecutive NUL characters, i.e., a
       starting point with a Zero-length file name is not allowed
       and will lead to an error diagnostic followed by a non-Zero
       exit code later.

       In the case the given file is empty, find does not process
       any starting point and therefore will exit immediately
       after parsing the program arguments.  This is unlike the
       standard invocation where find assumes the current
       directory as starting point if no path argument is passed.

       The processing of the starting points is otherwise as
       usual, e.g. find will recurse into subdirectories unless
       otherwise prevented.  To process only the starting points,
       one can additionally pass -maxdepth 0.

       Further notes: if a file is listed more than once in the
       input file, it is unspecified whether it is visited more
       than once.  If the file is mutated during the operation of
       find, the result is unspecified as well.  Finally, the seek
       position within the named file at the time find exits, be
       it with -quit or in any other way, is also unspecified.  By
       "unspecified" here is meant that it may or may not work or
       do any specific thing, and that the behavior may change
       from platform to platform, or from findutils release to
       release.

-help, --help
       Print a summary of the command-line usage of find and exit.

-ignore_readdir_race
       Normally, find will emit an error message when it fails to
       stat a file.  If you give this option and a file is deleted
       between the time find reads the name of the file from the
       directory and the time it tries to stat the file, no error
       message will be issued.  This also applies to files or
       directories whose names are given on the command line.
       This option takes effect at the time the command line is
       read, which means that you cannot search one part of the
       filesystem with this option on and part of it with this
       option off (if you need to do that, you will need to issue
       two find commands instead, one with the option and one
       without it).

       Furthermore, find with the -ignore_readdir_race option will
       ignore errors of the -delete action in the case the file
       has disappeared since the parent directory was read: it
       will not output an error diagnostic, and the return code of
       the -delete action will be true.

-maxdepth levels
       Descend at most levels (a non-negative integer) levels of
       directories below the starting-points.  Using -maxdepth 0
       means only apply the tests and actions to the starting-
       points themselves.

-mindepth levels
       Do not apply any tests or actions at levels less than
       levels (a non-negative integer).  Using -mindepth 1 means
       process all files except the starting-points.

-mount Ignore files on other devices.

-noignore_readdir_race
       Turns off the effect of -ignore_readdir_race.

-noleaf
       Do not optimize by assuming that directories contain 2
       fewer subdirectories than their hard link count.  This
       option is needed when searching filesystems that do not
       follow the Unix directory-link convention, such as CD-ROM
       or MS-DOS filesystems or AFS volume mount points.  Each
       directory on a normal Unix filesystem has at least 2 hard
       links: its name and its `.' entry.  Additionally, its
       subdirectories (if any) each have a `..' entry linked to
       that directory.  When find is examining a directory, after
       it has statted 2 fewer subdirectories than the directory's
       link count, it knows that the rest of the entries in the
       directory are non-directories (`leaf' files in the
       directory tree).  If only the files' names need to be
       examined, there is no need to stat them; this gives a
       significant increase in search speed.

-version, --version
       Print the find version number and exit.

-xdev  Don't descend into directories on other devices.

### TESTS

Some tests, for example -newerXY and -samefile, allow comparison
between the file currently being examined and some reference file
specified on the command line.  When these tests are used, the
interpretation of the reference file is determined by the options
-H, -L and -P and any previous -follow, but the reference file is
only examined once, at the time the command line is parsed.  If
the reference file cannot be examined (for example, the stat(2)
system call fails for it), an error message is issued, and find
exits with a nonzero status.

A numeric argument n can be specified to tests (like -amin,
-mtime, -gid, -inum, -links, -size, -uid and -used) as

+n     for greater than n,

-n     for less than n,

n      for exactly n.

Supported tests:

-amin n
       File was last accessed less than, more than or exactly n
       minutes ago.

-anewer reference
       Like -newer, but test if the time of the last access of the
       current file is more recent than that of the last data
       modification of the reference file.  Fails if the
       timestamps are equal.  If reference is a symbolic link and
       the -H option or the -L option is in effect, then the time
       of the last data modification of the file it points to is
       always used.

-atime n
       File was last accessed less than, more than or exactly n*24
       hours ago.  When find figures out how many 24-hour periods
       ago the file was last accessed, any fractional part is
       ignored, so to match -atime +1, a file has to have been
       accessed at least two days ago.

-cmin n
       File's status was last changed less than, more than or
       exactly n minutes ago.

-cnewer reference
       Like -newer, but test if the time of the last status change
       of the current file is more recent than that of the last
       data modification of the reference file.  Fails if the
       timestamps are equal.  If reference is a symbolic link and
       the -H option or the -L option is in effect, then the time
       of the last data modification of the file it points to is
       always used.

-ctime n
       File's status was last changed less than, more than or
       exactly n*24 hours ago.  See the comments for -atime to
       understand how rounding affects the interpretation of file
       status change times.

-empty File is empty and is either a regular file or a directory.

-executable
       Matches files which are executable and directories which
       are searchable (in a file name resolution sense) by the
       current user.  This takes into account access control lists
       and other permissions artefacts which the -perm test
       ignores.  This test makes use of the access(2) system call,
       and so can be fooled by NFS servers which do UID mapping
       (or root-squashing), since many systems implement access(2)
       in the client's kernel and so cannot make use of the UID
       mapping information held on the server.  Because this test
       is based only on the result of the access(2) system call,
       there is no guarantee that a file for which this test
       succeeds can actually be executed.

-false Always false.

-fstype type
       File is on a filesystem of type type.  The valid filesystem
       types vary among different versions of Unix; an incomplete
       list of filesystem types that are accepted on some version
       of Unix or another is: ufs, 4.2, 4.3, nfs, tmp, mfs, S51K,
       S52K.  You can use -printf with the %F directive to see the
       types of your filesystems.

-gid n File's numeric group ID is less than, more than or exactly
       n.

-group gname
       File belongs to group gname (numeric group ID allowed).

-ilname pattern
       Like -lname, but the match is case insensitive.  If the -L
       option or the -follow option is in effect, this test
       returns false unless the symbolic link is broken.

-iname pattern
       Like -name, but the match is case insensitive.  For
       example, the patterns `fo*' and `F??' match the file names
       `Foo', `FOO', `foo', `fOo', etc.  The pattern `*foo*` will
       also match a file called '.foobar'.

-inum n
       File has inode number smaller than, greater than or exactly
       n.  It is normally easier to use the -samefile test
       instead.

-ipath pattern
       Like -path.  but the match is case insensitive.

-iregex pattern
       Like -regex, but the match is case insensitive.

-iwholename pattern
       See -ipath.  This alternative is less portable than -ipath.

-links n
       File has less than, more than or exactly n hard links.

-lname pattern
       File is a symbolic link whose contents match shell pattern
       pattern.  The metacharacters do not treat `/' or `.'
       specially.  If the -L option or the -follow option is in
       effect, this test returns false unless the symbolic link is
       broken.

-mmin n
       File's data was last modified less than, more than or
       exactly n minutes ago.

-mtime n
       File's data was last modified less than, more than or
       exactly n*24 hours ago.  See the comments for -atime to
       understand how rounding affects the interpretation of file
       modification times.

-name pattern
       Base of file name (the path with the leading directories
       removed) matches shell pattern pattern.  Because the
       leading directories of the file names are removed, the
       pattern should not include a slash, because `-name a/b'
       will never match anything (and you probably want to use
       -path instead).  An exception to this is when using only a
       slash as pattern (`-name /'), because that is a valid
       string for matching the root directory "/" (because the
       base name of "/" is "/").  A warning is issued if you try
       to pass a pattern containing a - but not consisting solely
       of one - slash, unless the environment variable
       POSIXLY_CORRECT is set or the option -nowarn is used.

       To ignore a directory and the files under it, use -prune
       rather than checking every file in the tree; see an example
       in the description of that action.  Braces are not
       recognised as being special, despite the fact that some
       shells including Bash imbue braces with a special meaning
       in shell patterns.  The filename matching is performed with
       the use of the fnmatch(3) library function.  Don't forget
       to enclose the pattern in quotes in order to protect it
       from expansion by the shell.

-newer reference
       Succeeds if the time of the last data modification of the
       current file is more recent than that of the last data
       modification of the reference file.  Fails if the
       timestamps are equal.  If reference is a symbolic link and
       the -H option or the -L option is in effect, then the time
       of the last data modification of the file it points to is
       always used.

-newerXY reference
       Succeeds if timestamp X of the file being considered is
       newer than the timestamp Y of the file reference.  Fails if
       the timestamps are equal.  The letters X and Y can be any
       of the following letters:

       a   The access time of the file reference
       B   The birth time of the file reference
       c   The inode status change time of reference
       m   The modification time of the file reference
       t   reference is interpreted directly as a time

       Some combinations are invalid; for example, it is invalid
       for X to be t.  Some combinations are not implemented on
       all systems; for example B is not supported on all systems.
       If an invalid or unsupported combination of XY is
       specified, a fatal error results.  Time specifications are
       interpreted as for the argument to the -d option of GNU
       date.  If you try to use the birth time of a reference
       file, and the birth time cannot be determined, a fatal
       error message results.  If you specify a test which refers
       to the birth time of files being examined, this test will
       fail for any files where the birth time is unknown.

-nogroup
       No group corresponds to file's numeric group ID.

-nouser
       No user corresponds to file's numeric user ID.

-path pattern
       File name matches shell pattern pattern.  The
       metacharacters do not treat `/' or `.' specially; so, for
       example,
           find . -path "./sr*sc"
       will print an entry for a directory called ./src/misc (if
       one exists).  To ignore a whole directory tree, use -prune
       rather than checking every file in the tree.  Note that the
       pattern match test applies to the whole file name, starting
       from one of the start points named on the command line.  It
       would only make sense to use an absolute path name here if
       the relevant start point is also an absolute path.  This
       means that this command will never match anything:
           find bar -path /foo/bar/myfile -print
       Find compares the -path argument with the concatenation of
       a directory name and the base name of the file it's
       examining.  Since the concatenation will never end with a
       slash, -path arguments ending in a slash will match nothing
       (except perhaps a start point specified on the command
       line).  The predicate -path is also supported by HP-UX find
       and is part of the POSIX 2008 standard.

-perm mode
       File's permission bits are exactly mode (octal or
       symbolic).  Since an exact match is required, if you want
       to use this form for symbolic modes, you may have to
       specify a rather complex mode string.  For example `-perm
       g=w' will only match files which have mode 0020 (that is,
       ones for which group write permission is the only
       permission set).  It is more likely that you will want to
       use the `/' or `-' forms, for example `-perm -g=w', which
       matches any file with group write permission.  See the
       EXAMPLES section for some illustrative examples.

-perm -mode
       All of the permission bits mode are set for the file.
       Symbolic modes are accepted in this form, and this is
       usually the way in which you would want to use them.  You
       must specify `u', `g' or `o' if you use a symbolic mode.
       See the EXAMPLES section for some illustrative examples.

-perm /mode
       Any of the permission bits mode are set for the file.
       Symbolic modes are accepted in this form.  You must specify
       `u', `g' or `o' if you use a symbolic mode.  See the
       EXAMPLES section for some illustrative examples.  If no
       permission bits in mode are set, this test matches any file
       (the idea here is to be consistent with the behaviour of
       -perm -000).

-perm +mode
       This is no longer supported (and has been deprecated since
       2005).  Use -perm /mode instead.

-readable
       Matches files which are readable by the current user.  This
       takes into account access control lists and other
       permissions artefacts which the -perm test ignores.  This
       test makes use of the access(2) system call, and so can be
       fooled by NFS servers which do UID mapping (or root-
       squashing), since many systems implement access(2) in the
       client's kernel and so cannot make use of the UID mapping
       information held on the server.

-regex pattern
       File name matches regular expression pattern.  This is a
       match on the whole path, not a search.  For example, to
       match a file named ./fubar3, you can use the regular
       expression `.*bar.' or `.*b.*3', but not `f.*r3'.  The
       regular expressions understood by find are by default Emacs
       Regular Expressions, but this can be changed with the
       -regextype option.

-samefile name
       File refers to the same inode as name.  When -L is in
       effect, this can include symbolic links.

-size n[cwbkMG]
       File uses less than, more than or exactly n units of space,
       rounding up.  The following suffixes can be used:

       `b'    for 512-byte blocks (this is the default if no
              suffix is used)

       `c'    for bytes

       `w'    for two-byte words

       `k'    for kibibytes (KiB, units of 1024 bytes)

       `M'    for mebibytes (MiB, units of 1024 * 1024 = 1048576
              bytes)

       `G'    for gibibytes (GiB, units of 1024 * 1024 * 1024 =
              1073741824 bytes)

       The size is simply the st_size member of the struct stat
       populated by the lstat (or stat) system call, rounded up as
       shown above.  In other words, it's consistent with the
       result you get for ls -l.  Bear in mind that the `%k' and
       `%b' format specifiers of -printf handle sparse files
       differently.  The `b' suffix always denotes 512-byte blocks
       and never 1024-byte blocks, which is different to the
       behaviour of -ls.

       The + and - prefixes signify greater than and less than, as
       usual; i.e., an exact size of n units does not match.  Bear
       in mind that the size is rounded up to the next unit.
       Therefore -size -1M is not equivalent to -size -1048576c.
       The former only matches empty files, the latter matches
       files from 0 to 1,048,575 bytes.

-true  Always true.

-type c
       File is of type c:

       b      block (buffered) special

       c      character (unbuffered) special

       d      directory

       p      named pipe (FIFO)

       f      regular file

       l      symbolic link; this is never true if the -L option
              or the -follow option is in effect, unless the
              symbolic link is broken.  If you want to search for
              symbolic links when -L is in effect, use -xtype.

       s      socket

       D      door (Solaris)

       To search for more than one type at once, you can supply
       the combined list of type letters separated by a comma `,'
       (GNU extension).

-uid n File's numeric user ID is less than, more than or exactly
       n.

-used n
       File was last accessed less than, more than or exactly n
       days after its status was last changed.

-user uname
       File is owned by user uname (numeric user ID allowed).

-wholename pattern
       See -path.  This alternative is less portable than -path.

-writable
       Matches files which are writable by the current user.  This
       takes into account access control lists and other
       permissions artefacts which the -perm test ignores.  This
       test makes use of the access(2) system call, and so can be
       fooled by NFS servers which do UID mapping (or root-
       squashing), since many systems implement access(2) in the
       client's kernel and so cannot make use of the UID mapping
       information held on the server.

-xtype c
       The same as -type unless the file is a symbolic link.  For
       symbolic links: if the -H or -P option was specified, true
       if the file is a link to a file of type c; if the -L option
       has been given, true if c is `l'.  In other words, for
       symbolic links, -xtype checks the type of the file that
       -type does not check.  If a symbolic link is broken
       (because the thing it points to does not exist or the link
       points to itself) then -xtype will behave the same as
       -type.

-context pattern
       (SELinux only) Security context of the file matches glob
       pattern.

### ACTIONS

-delete
       Delete files or directories; true if removal succeeded.  If
       the removal failed, an error message is issued and find's
       exit status will be nonzero (when it eventually exits).

       Warning: Don't forget that find evaluates the command line
       as an expression, so putting -delete first will make find
       try to delete everything below the starting points you
       specified.

       The use of the -delete action on the command line
       automatically turns on the -depth option.  As in turn
       -depth makes -prune ineffective, the -delete action cannot
       usefully be combined with -prune.  Often, the user might
       want to test a find command line with -print prior to
       adding -delete for the actual removal run.  To avoid
       surprising results, it is usually best to remember to use
       -depth explicitly during those earlier test runs.

       The -delete action will fail to remove a directory unless
       it is empty.

       Together with the -ignore_readdir_race option, find will
       ignore errors of the -delete action in the case the file
       has disappeared since the parent directory was read: it
       will not output an error diagnostic, not change the exit
       code to nonzero, and the return code of the -delete action
       will be true.

-exec command ;
       Execute command; true if 0 status is returned.  All
       following arguments to find are taken to be arguments to
       the command until an argument consisting of `;' is
       encountered.  The string `{}' is replaced by the current
       file name being processed everywhere it occurs in the
       arguments to the command, not just in arguments where it is
       alone, as in some versions of find.  Both of these
       constructions might need to be escaped (with a `\') or
       quoted to protect them from expansion by the shell.  See
       the EXAMPLES section for examples of the use of the -exec
       option.  The specified command is run once for each matched
       file.  The command is executed in the starting directory.
       There are unavoidable security problems surrounding use of
       the -exec action; you should use the -execdir option
       instead.

-exec command {} +
       This variant of the -exec action runs the specified command
       on the selected files, but the command line is built by
       appending each selected file name at the end; the total
       number of invocations of the command will be much less than
       the number of matched files.  The command line is built in
       much the same way that xargs builds its command lines.
       Only one instance of `{}' is allowed within the command,
       and it must appear at the end, immediately before the `+';
       it needs to be escaped (with a `\') or quoted to protect it
       from interpretation by the shell.  The command is executed
       in the starting directory.  If any invocation with the `+'
       form returns a non-zero value as exit status, then find
       returns a non-zero exit status.  If find encounters an
       error, this can sometimes cause an immediate exit, so some
       pending commands may not be run at all.  For this reason
       -exec my-command ... {} + -quit may not result in my-
       command actually being run.  This variant of -exec always
       returns true.

-execdir command ;

-execdir command {} +
       Like -exec, but the specified command is run from the
       subdirectory containing the matched file, which is not
       normally the directory in which you started find.  Each
       selected file name except for the root directory "/" is
       prepended with "./".  As with -exec, the {} should be
       quoted if find is being invoked from a shell.  This a much
       more secure method for invoking commands, as it avoids race
       conditions during resolution of the paths to the matched
       files.  As with the -exec action, the `+' form of -execdir
       will build a command line to process more than one matched
       file, but any given invocation of command will only list
       files that exist in the same subdirectory.  If you use this
       option, you must ensure that your PATH environment variable
       does not reference `.'; otherwise, an attacker can run any
       commands they like by leaving an appropriately-named file
       in a directory in which you will run -execdir.  The same
       applies to having entries in PATH which are empty or which
       are not absolute directory names.  If any invocation with
       the `+' form returns a non-zero value as exit status, then
       find returns a non-zero exit status.  If find encounters an
       error, this can sometimes cause an immediate exit, so some
       pending commands may not be run at all.  The result of the
       action depends on whether the + or the ; variant is being
       used; -execdir command {} + always returns true, while
       -execdir command {} ; returns true only if command returns
       0.

-fls file
       True; like -ls but write to file like -fprint.  The output
       file is always created, even if the predicate is never
       matched.  See the UNUSUAL FILENAMES section for information
       about how unusual characters in filenames are handled.

-fprint file
       True; print the full file name into file file.  If file
       does not exist when find is run, it is created; if it does
       exist, it is truncated.  The file names /dev/stdout and
       /dev/stderr are handled specially; they refer to the
       standard output and standard error output, respectively.
       The output file is always created, even if the predicate is
       never matched.  See the UNUSUAL FILENAMES section for
       information about how unusual characters in filenames are
       handled.

-fprint0 file
       True; like -print0 but write to file like -fprint.  The
       output file is always created, even if the predicate is
       never matched.  See the UNUSUAL FILENAMES section for
       information about how unusual characters in filenames are
       handled.

-fprintf file format
       True; like -printf but write to file like -fprint.  The
       output file is always created, even if the predicate is
       never matched.  See the UNUSUAL FILENAMES section for
       information about how unusual characters in filenames are
       handled.

-ls    True; list current file in ls -dils format on standard
       output.  The block counts are of 1 KiB blocks, unless the
       environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in which case
       512-byte blocks are used.  See the UNUSUAL FILENAMES
       section for information about how unusual characters in
       filenames are handled.

-ok command ;
       Like -exec but ask the user first.  If the user agrees, run
       the command.  Otherwise just return false.  If the command
       is run, its standard input is redirected from /dev/null.
       This action may not be specified together with the
       -files0-from option.

       The response to the prompt is matched against a pair of
       regular expressions to determine if it is an affirmative or
       negative response.  This regular expression is obtained
       from the system if the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable
       is set, or otherwise from find's message translations.  If
       the system has no suitable definition, find's own
       definition will be used.  In either case, the
       interpretation of the regular expression itself will be
       affected by the environment variables LC_CTYPE (character
       classes) and LC_COLLATE (character ranges and equivalence
       classes).

-okdir command ;
       Like -execdir but ask the user first in the same way as for
       -ok.  If the user does not agree, just return false.  If
       the command is run, its standard input is redirected from
       /dev/null.  This action may not be specified together with
       the -files0-from option.

-print True; print the full file name on the standard output,
       followed by a newline.  If you are piping the output of
       find into another program and there is the faintest
       possibility that the files which you are searching for
       might contain a newline, then you should seriously consider
       using the -print0 option instead of -print.  See the
       UNUSUAL FILENAMES section for information about how unusual
       characters in filenames are handled.

-print0
       True; print the full file name on the standard output,
       followed by a null character (instead of the newline
       character that -print uses).  This allows file names that
       contain newlines or other types of white space to be
       correctly interpreted by programs that process the find
       output.  This option corresponds to the -0 option of xargs.

-printf format
       True; print format on the standard output, interpreting `\'
       escapes and `%' directives.  Field widths and precisions
       can be specified as with the printf(3) C function.  Please
       note that many of the fields are printed as %s rather than
       %d, and this may mean that flags don't work as you might
       expect.  This also means that the `-' flag does work (it
       forces fields to be left-aligned).  Unlike -print, -printf
       does not add a newline at the end of the string.  The
       escapes and directives are:

       \a     Alarm bell.

       \b     Backspace.

       \c     Stop printing from this format immediately and flush
              the output.

       \f     Form feed.

       \n     Newline.

       \r     Carriage return.

       \t     Horizontal tab.

       \v     Vertical tab.

       \0     ASCII NUL.

       \\     A literal backslash (`\').

       \NNN   The character whose ASCII code is NNN (octal).

       A `\' character followed by any other character is treated
       as an ordinary character, so they both are printed.

       %%     A literal percent sign.

       %a     File's last access time in the format returned by
              the C ctime(3) function.

       %Ak    File's last access time in the format specified by
              k, which is either `@' or a directive for the C
              strftime(3) function.  The following shows an
              incomplete list of possible values for k.  Please
              refer to the documentation of strftime(3) for the
              full list.  Some of the conversion specification
              characters might not be available on all systems,
              due to differences in the implementation of the
              strftime(3) library function.

              T      time, 24-hour (hh:mm:ss.xxxxxxxxxx)

              +      Date and time, separated by `+', for example
                     `2004-04-28+22:22:05.0'.  This is a GNU
                     extension.  The time is given in the current
                     timezone (which may be affected by setting
                     the TZ environment variable).  The seconds
                     field includes a fractional part.

              X      locale's time representation (H:M:S).  The
                     seconds field includes a fractional part.

              Z      time zone (e.g., EDT), or nothing if no time
                     zone is determinable

              Date fields:

              a      locale's abbreviated weekday name (Sun..Sat)

              A      locale's full weekday name, variable length
                     (Sunday..Saturday)

              b      locale's abbreviated month name (Jan..Dec)

                     EST 1989).  The format is the same as for
                     ctime(3) and so to preserve compatibility
                     with that format, there is no fractional part
                     in the seconds field.

       %b     The amount of disk space used for this file in
              512-byte blocks.  Since disk space is allocated in
              multiples of the filesystem block size this is
              usually greater than %s/512, but it can also be
              smaller if the file is a sparse file.

       %Bk    File's birth time, i.e., its creation time, in the
              format specified by k, which is the same as for %A.
              This directive produces an empty string if the
              underlying operating system or filesystem does not
              support birth times.

       %c     File's last status change time in the format
              returned by the C ctime(3) function.

       %Ck    File's last status change time in the format
              specified by k, which is the same as for %A.

       %d     File's depth in the directory tree; 0 means the file
              is a starting-point.

       %D     The device number on which the file exists (the
              st_dev field of struct stat), in decimal.

       %f     Print the basename; the file's name with any leading
              directories removed (only the last element).  For /,
              the result is `/'.  See the EXAMPLES section for an
              example.

       %F     Type of the filesystem the file is on; this value
              can be used for -fstype.

       %g     File's group name, or numeric group ID if the group
              has no name.

       %G     File's numeric group ID.

       %h     Dirname; the Leading directories of the file's name
              (all but the last element).  If the file name
              contains no slashes (since it is in the current
              directory) the %h specifier expands to `.'.  For
              files which are themselves directories and contain a
              slash (including /), %h expands to the empty string.
              See the EXAMPLES section for an example.

       %H     Starting-point under which file was found.

       %i     File's inode number (in decimal).

       %k     The amount of disk space used for this file in 1 KiB
              blocks.  Since disk space is allocated in multiples
              of the filesystem block size this is usually greater
              than %s/1024, but it can also be smaller if the file
              is a sparse file.

       %l     Object of symbolic link (empty string if file is not
              a symbolic link).

       %m     File's permission bits (in octal).  This option uses
              the `traditional' numbers which most Unix
              implementations use, but if your particular
              implementation uses an unusual ordering of octal
              permissions bits, you will see a difference between
              the actual value of the file's mode and the output
              of %m.  Normally you will want to have a leading
              zero on this number, and to do this, you should use
              the # flag (as in, for example, `%#m').

       %M     File's permissions (in symbolic form, as for ls).
              This directive is supported in findutils 4.2.5 and
              later.

       %n     Number of hard links to file.

       %p     File's name.

       %P     File's name with the name of the starting-point
              under which it was found removed.

       %s     File's size in bytes.

       %S     File's sparseness.  This is calculated as
              (BLOCKSIZE*st_blocks / st_size).  The exact value
              you will get for an ordinary file of a certain
              length is system-dependent.  However, normally
              sparse files will have values less than 1.0, and
              files which use indirect blocks may have a value
              which is greater than 1.0.  In general the number of
              blocks used by a file is file system dependent.  The
              value used for BLOCKSIZE is system-dependent, but is
              usually 512 bytes.  If the file size is zero, the
              value printed is undefined.  On systems which lack
              support for st_blocks, a file's sparseness is
              assumed to be 1.0.

       %t     File's last modification time in the format returned
              by the C ctime(3) function.

       %Tk    File's last modification time in the format
              specified by k, which is the same as for %A.

       %u     File's user name, or numeric user ID if the user has
              no name.

       %U     File's numeric user ID.

       %y     File's type (like in ls -l), U=unknown type
              (shouldn't happen)

       %Y     File's type (like %y), plus follow symbolic links:
              `L'=loop, `N'=nonexistent, `?' for any other error
              when determining the type of the target of a
              symbolic link.

       %Z     (SELinux only) file's security context.

       %{ %[ %(
              Reserved for future use.

       A `%' character followed by any other character is
       discarded, but the other character is printed (don't rely
       on this, as further format characters may be introduced).
       A `%' at the end of the format argument causes undefined
       behaviour since there is no following character.  In some
       locales, it may hide your door keys, while in others it may

       %m and %d directives support the #, 0 and + flags, but the
       other directives do not, even if they print numbers.
       Numeric directives that do not support these flags include
       G, U, b, D, k and n.  The `-' format flag is supported and
       changes the alignment of a field from right-justified
       (which is the default) to left-justified.

       See the UNUSUAL FILENAMES section for information about how
       unusual characters in filenames are handled.

-prune True; if the file is a directory, do not descend into it.
       If -depth is given, then -prune has no effect.  Because
       -delete implies -depth, you cannot usefully use -prune and
       -delete together.  For example, to skip the directory
       src/emacs and all files and directories under it, and print
       the names of the other files found, do something like this:
           find . -path ./src/emacs -prune -o -print

-quit  Exit immediately (with return value zero if no errors have
       occurred).  This is different to -prune because -prune only
       applies to the contents of pruned directories, while -quit
       simply makes find stop immediately.  No child processes
       will be left running.  Any command lines which have been
       built by -exec ... + or -execdir ... + are invoked before
       the program is exited.  After -quit is executed, no more
       files specified on the command line will be processed.  For
       example, `find /tmp/foo /tmp/bar -print -quit` will print
       only `/tmp/foo`.
       One common use of -quit is to stop searching the file
       system once we have found what we want.  For example, if we
       want to find just a single file we can do this:
           find / -name needle -print -quit

### OPERATORS

Listed in order of decreasing precedence:

( expr )
       Force precedence.  Since parentheses are special to the
       shell, you will normally need to quote them.  Many of the
       examples in this manual page use backslashes for this
       purpose: `\(...\)' instead of `(...)'.

! expr True if expr is false.  This character will also usually
       need protection from interpretation by the shell.

-not expr
       Same as ! expr, but not POSIX compliant.

expr1 expr2
       Two expressions in a row are taken to be joined with an
       implied -a; expr2 is not evaluated if expr1 is false.

expr1 -a expr2
       Same as expr1 expr2.

expr1 -and expr2
       Same as expr1 expr2, but not POSIX compliant.

expr1 -o expr2
       Or; expr2 is not evaluated if expr1 is true.

expr1 -or expr2
       Same as expr1 -o expr2, but not POSIX compliant.

expr1 , expr2
       List; both expr1 and expr2 are always evaluated.  The value
       of expr1 is discarded; the value of the list is the value
       of expr2.  The comma operator can be useful for searching
       for several different types of thing, but traversing the
       filesystem hierarchy only once.  The -fprintf action can be
       used to list the various matched items into several
       different output files.

Please note that -a when specified implicitly (for example by two
tests appearing without an explicit operator between them) or
explicitly has higher precedence than -o.  This means that find .
-name afile -o -name bfile -print will never print afile.
