PS(1)                    General Commands Manual                    PS(1)


## NAME

ps - report a snapshot of the current processes.


## SYNOPSIS

ps [option ...]


## DESCRIPTION

ps displays information about a selection of the active processes.
If you want a repetitive update of the selection and the displayed
information, use top instead.

This version of ps accepts several kinds of options.

•   Unix options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a
    dash.

•   BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a
    dash.

•   GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.

Options of different types may be freely mixed, but conflicts can
appear.  There are some synonymous options, which are functionally
identical, due to the many standards and ps implementations that
this ps is compatible with.

By default, ps selects all processes with the same effective user
ID (euid=EUID) as the current user and associated with the same
terminal as the invoker.  It displays the process ID (pid=PID),
the terminal associated with the process (tname=TTY), the
cumulated CPU time in [DD-]hh:mm:ss format (time=TIME), and the
executable name (ucmd=CMD).  Output is unsorted by default.

The use of BSD-style options will add process state (stat=STAT) to
the default display and show the command args (args=COMMAND)
instead of the executable name.  You can override this with the
PS_FORMAT environment variable.  The use of BSD-style options will
also change the process selection to include processes on other
terminals (TTYs) that are owned by you; alternately, this may be
described as setting the selection to be the set of all processes
filtered to exclude processes owned by other users or not on a
terminal.  These effects are not considered when options are
described as being "identical" below, so -M will be considered
identical to Z and so on.

Except as described below, process selection options are additive.
The default selection is discarded, and then the selected
processes are added to the set of processes to be displayed.  A
process will thus be shown if it meets any of the given selection
criteria.


## EXAMPLES

To see every process on the system using standard syntax:
   ps -e
   ps -ef
   ps -eF
   ps -ely

To see every process on the system using BSD syntax:
   ps ax
   ps axu

To print a process tree:
   ps -ejH
   ps axjf

To get info about threads:
   ps -eLf
   ps axms

To get security info:
   ps -eo euser,ruser,suser,fuser,f,comm,label
   ps axZ
   ps -eM

To see every process running as root (real & effective ID) in user
format:
   ps -U root -u root u

To see every process with a user-defined format:
   ps -eo pid,tid,class,rtprio,ni,pri,psr,pcpu,stat,wchan:14,comm
   ps axo stat,euid,ruid,tty,tpgid,sess,pgrp,ppid,pid,pcpu,comm

Print only the process IDs of syslogd:
   ps -C syslogd -o pid=

Print only the name of PID 42:
   ps -q 42 -o comm=


## SIMPLE PROCESS SELECTION

a      Lift the BSD-style "only yourself" restriction, which is
       imposed upon the set of all processes when some BSD-style
       (without "-") options are used or when the ps personality
       setting is BSD-like.  The set of processes selected in this
       manner is in addition to the set of processes selected by
       other means.  An alternate description is that this option
       causes ps to list all processes with a terminal (tty), or
       to list all processes when used together with the x option.

-A     Select all processes.  Identical to -e.

-a     Select all processes except both session leaders (see
       getsid(2)) and processes not associated with a terminal.

-d     Select all processes except session leaders.

--deselect
       Select all processes except those that fulfill the
       specified conditions (negates the selection).  Identical to
       -N.

-e     Select all processes.  Identical to -A.

g      Really all, even session leaders.  This flag is obsolete
       and may be discontinued in a future release.  It is
       normally implied by the a flag, and is only useful when
       operating in the sunos4 personality.

-N     Select all processes except those that fulfill the
       specified conditions (negates the selection).  Identical to
       --deselect.

T      Select all processes associated with this terminal.
       Identical to the t option without any argument.

r      Restrict the selection to only running processes.

x      Lift the BSD-style "must have a tty" restriction, which is
       imposed upon the set of all processes when some BSD-style
       (without "-") options are used or when the ps personality
       setting is BSD-like.  The set of processes selected in this
       manner is in addition to the set of processes selected by
       other means.  An alternate description is that this option
       causes ps to list all processes owned by you (same EUID as
       ps), or to list all processes when used together with the a
       option.


## PROCESS SELECTION BY LIST

These options accept a single argument in the form of a
blank-separated or comma-separated list.  They can be used
multiple times.  For example: ps -p "1 2" -p 3,4

123    Identical to --pid 123.

+123   Identical to --sid 123.

-123   Select by process group ID (PGID).

-C cmdlist
       Select by command name.  This selects the processes whose
       executable name is given in cmdlist.  NOTE: The command
       name is not the same as the command line. Previous versions
       of procps and the kernel truncated this command name to 15
       characters. This limitation is no longer present in both.
       If you depended on matching only 15 characters, you may no
       longer get a match.

-G grplist
       Select by real group ID (RGID) or name.  This selects the
       processes whose real group name or ID is in the grplist
       list.  The real group ID identifies the group of the user
       who created the process, see getgid(2).

-g grplist
       Select by session OR by effective group name.  Selection by
       session is specified by many standards, but selection by
       effective group is the logical behavior that several other
       operating systems use.  This ps will select by session when
       the list is completely numeric (as sessions are).  Group ID
       numbers will work only when some group names are also
       specified.  See the -s and --group options.

--Group grplist
       Select by real group ID (RGID) or name.  Identical to -G.

--group grplist
       Select by effective group ID (EGID) or name.  This selects
       the processes whose effective group name or ID is in
       grplist.  The effective group ID describes the group whose
       file access permissions are used by the process (see
       getegid(2)).  The -g option is often an alternative to
       --group.

p pidlist
       Select by process ID.  Identical to -p and --pid.

-p pidlist
       Select by PID.  This selects the processes whose process ID
       numbers appear in pidlist.  Identical to p and --pid.

--pid pidlist
       Select by process ID.  Identical to -p and p.

--ppid pidlist
       Select by parent process ID.  This selects the processes
       with a parent process ID in pidlist.  That is, it selects
       processes that are children of those listed in pidlist.

q pidlist
       Select by process ID (quick mode).  Identical to -q and
       --quick-pid.

-q pidlist
       Select by PID (quick mode).  This selects the processes
       whose process ID numbers appear in pidlist.  With this
       option ps reads the necessary info only for the pids listed
       in the pidlist and doesn't apply additional filtering
       rules. The order of pids is unsorted and preserved. No
       additional selection options, sorting and forest type
       listings are allowed in this mode.  Identical to q and
       --quick-pid.

--quick-pid pidlist
       Select by process ID (quick mode).  Identical to -q and q.

-s sesslist
       Select by session ID.  This selects the processes with a
       session ID specified in sesslist.

--sid sesslist
       Select by session ID.  Identical to -s.

t ttylist
       Select by tty.  Nearly identical to -t and --tty, but can
       also be used with an empty ttylist to indicate the terminal
       associated with ps.  Using the T option is considered
       cleaner than using t with an empty ttylist.

-t ttylist
       Select by tty.  This selects the processes associated with
       the terminals given in ttylist.  Terminals (ttys, or
       screens for text output) can be specified in several forms:
       /dev/ttyS1, ttyS1, S1.  A plain "-" may be used to select
       processes not attached to any terminal.

--tty ttylist
       Select by terminal.  Identical to -t and t.

U userlist
       Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  This selects
       the processes whose effective user name or ID is in
       userlist.  The effective user ID describes the user whose
       file access permissions are used by the process (see
       geteuid(2)).  Identical to -u and --user.

-U userlist
       Select by real user ID (RUID) or name.  It selects the
       processes whose real user name or ID is in the userlist
       list.  The real user ID identifies the user who created the
       process, see getuid(2).

-u userlist
       Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  This selects
       the processes whose effective user name or ID is in
       userlist.

The effective user ID describes the user whose file access
permissions are used by the process (see geteuid(2)).  Identical
to U and --user.

--User userlist
       Select by real user ID (RUID) or name.  Identical to -U.

--user userlist
       Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  Identical to
       -u and U.


## OUTPUT FORMAT CONTROL

These options are used to choose the information displayed by ps.
The output may differ by personality. The options in brackets at
the end of the description are the format equivalents.

-c     Show different scheduler information for the -l option. (-O
       cls,pri).

--context
       Display security context format (for SELinux). (-o
       pid,context,cmd).

-f     Do full-format listing.  This option can be combined with
       many other Unix-style options to add additional columns.
       It also causes the command arguments to be printed.  When
       used with -L, the NLWP (number of threads) and LWP (thread
       ID) columns will be added.  See the c option, the format
       keyword args, and the format keyword comm.  (-o
       uid,pid,ppid,c,stime,tty,time,cmd).

-F     Extra full format.  See the -f option, which -F implies.
       (-o uid,pid,ppid,c,sz,rss,psr,stime,tty,time,cmd).

--format format
       user-defined format.  Identical to -o and o.

j      BSD job control format. (-o
       ppid,pid,pgid,sid,tty,tpgid,stat,uid,time,cmd a)

-j     Jobs format. (-o pid,pgid,sid,tty,time,ucmd)

l      Display BSD long format. (-o
       f,uid,pid,ppid,pri,ni,vsz,rss,wchan,stat,tty,time,cmd a)

-l     Long format.  The -y option is often useful with this. (-o
       f,uid,pid,ppid,c,pri,ni,addr,sz,wchan,tty,time,ucmd)

-M     Add a column of security data.  Identical to Z (for
       SELinux). (-o context,pid,tty,time,ucmd)

O format
       is preloaded o (overloaded).  The BSD O option can act like
       -O (user-defined output format with some common fields
       predefined) or can be used to specify sort order.
       Heuristics are used to determine the behavior of this
       option.  To ensure that the desired behavior is obtained
       (sorting or formatting), specify the option in some other
       way (e.g., with -O or --sort).  When used as a formatting
       option, it is identical to -O, with the BSD personality.

-O format
       Like -o, but preloaded with some default columns.
       Identical to -o pid,format,state,tname,time,command or
       -o pid,format,tname,time,cmd, see -o below.

o format
       Specify user-defined format.  Identical to -o and --format.

-o format
       User-defined format.  format is a single argument in the
       form of a blank-separated or comma-separated list, which
       offers a way to specify individual output columns.  The
       recognized keywords are described in the STANDARD FORMAT
       SPECIFIERS section below.  Headers may be renamed (ps -o
       pid,ruser=RealUser -o comm=Command) as desired.  If all
       column headers are empty (ps -o pid= -o comm=) then the
       header line will not be output.  Column width will increase
       as needed for wide headers; this may be used to widen up
       columns such as WCHAN (ps -o pid,wchan=WIDE-WCHAN-COLUMN -o
       comm).  Explicit width control (ps opid,wchan:42,cmd) is
       offered too.  The behavior of ps -o pid=X,comm=Y varies
       with personality; output may be one column named "X,comm=Y"
       or two columns named "X" and "Y".  Use multiple -o options
       when in doubt.  Use the PS_FORMAT environment variable to
       specify a default as desired; DefSysV and DefBSD are macros
       that may be used to choose the default Unix or BSD columns.

-P     Add a column showing psr. (-o pid,psr,s,tty,time,ucmd)

s      Display signal format. (-o
       uid,pid,pending,blocked,ignored,caught,stat,tty,bsdtime,cmd
       a)

u      Display user-oriented format. (-o
       user,pid,pcpu,pmem,vsz,rss,tty,stat,start_time,bsdtime,args
       a)

v      Display virtual memory format. (-o
       pid,tty,stat,bsdtime,majflt,trs,drs,rss,pmem,args a)

X      Register format. ( -o
       pid,stackp,esp,eip,tmout,alarm,stat,tty,bsdtime,args a)

-y     Do not show flags; show rss in place of addr.  This option
       can only be used with -l.

Z      Add a column of security data.  Identical to -M (for
       SELinux).


## OUTPUT MODIFIERS

c      Show the true command name.  This is derived from the name
       of the executable file, rather than from the argv value.
       Command arguments and any modifications to them are thus
       not shown.  This option effectively turns the args format
       keyword into the comm format keyword; it is useful with the
       -f format option and with the various BSD-style format
       options, which all normally display the command arguments.
       See the -f option, the format keyword args, and the format
       keyword comm.

--cols n
       Set screen width.

--columns n
       Set screen width.

--cumulative
       Include some dead child process data (as a sum with the
       parent).

-D format
       Set the date format of the lstart field to format.  This
       format is parsed by strftime(3) and should be a maximum of
       24 characters to not mis-align columns.

--date-format format
       Identical to -D.

--delimiter delim
       Set the delimiter between each column to delim instead of
       variable space. Must be a single character.

e      Show the environment after the command.

f      ASCII art process hierarchy (forest).

--forest
       ASCII art process tree.

h      No header.  (or, one header per screen in the BSD
       personality).  The h option is problematic.  Standard BSD
       ps uses this option to print a header on each page of
       output, but older Linux ps uses this option to totally
       disable the header.  This version of ps follows the Linux
       usage of not printing the header unless the BSD personality
       has been selected, in which case it prints a header on each
       page of output.  Regardless of the current personality, you
       can use the long options --headers and --no-headers to
       enable printing headers each page or disable headers
       entirely, respectively.

-H     Show process hierarchy (forest).

--headers
       Repeat header lines, one per page of output.

k spec Specify sorting order.  Sorting syntax is
       [+|-]key[,[+|-]key[,...]].  Choose a multi-letter key from
       the STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS section.  The "+" is
       optional since default direction is increasing numerical or
       lexicographic order.  Identical to --sort.

               Examples:
               ps jaxkuid,-ppid,+pid
               ps axk comm o comm,args
               ps kstart_time -ef

--lines n
       Set screen height.

n      Numeric output for WCHAN and USER (including all types of
       UID and GID).

--no-headers
       Print no header line at all.  --no-heading is an alias for
       this option.

O order
       Sorting order (overloaded).  The BSD O option can act like
       -O (user-defined output format with some common fields
       predefined) or can be used to specify sort order.
       Heuristics are used to determine the behavior of this
       option.  To ensure that the desired behavior is obtained
       (sorting or formatting), specify the option in some other
       way (e.g., with -O or --sort).

       For sorting, obsolete BSD O option syntax is
       O[+|-]k1[,[+|-]k2[,...]].  It orders the processes listing
       according to the multilevel sort specified by the sequence
       of one-letter short keys k1,k2, ... described in the
       OBSOLETE SORT KEYS section below.  The "+" is currently
       optional, merely re-iterating the default direction on a
       key, but may help to distinguish an O sort from an O
       format.  The "-" reverses direction only on the key it
       precedes.

--rows n
       Set screen height.

S      Sum up some information, such as CPU usage, from dead child
       processes into their parent.  This is useful for examining
       a system where a parent process repeatedly forks off
       short-lived children to do work.

--sort spec
       Specify sorting order.  Sorting syntax is
       [+|-]key[,[+|-]key[,...]].  Choose a multi-letter key from
       the STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS section.  The "+" is
       optional since default direction is increasing numerical or
       lexicographic order.  Identical to k.  For example: ps jax
       --sort=uid,-ppid,+pid

--signames
       Show signal masks using abbreviated signal names and
       expands the column.  If the column width cannot show all
       signals, the column will end with a plus "+".  Columns with
       only a hyphen have no signals.

w      Wide output.  Use this option twice for unlimited width.

-w     Wide output.  Use this option twice for unlimited width.

--width n
       Set screen width.


## THREAD DISPLAY

H      Show threads as if they were processes.

-L     Show threads, possibly with LWP and NLWP columns.

m      Show threads after processes.

-m     Show threads after processes.

-T     Show threads, possibly with SPID column.


## OTHER INFORMATION

--help section
       Print a help message.  The section argument can be one of
       simple, list, output, threads, misc, or all.  The argument
       can be shortened to one of the underlined letters as in:
       s|l|o|t|m|a.

--info Print debugging info.

L      List all format specifiers.

V      Print the procps-ng version.

-V     Print the procps-ng version.

--version
       Print the procps-ng version.


## NOTES

This ps works by reading the virtual files in /proc.  This ps does
not need to be setuid kmem or have any privileges to run.  Do not
give this ps any special permissions.

CPU usage is currently expressed as the percentage of time spent
running during the entire lifetime of a process.  This is not
ideal, and it does not conform to the standards that ps otherwise
conforms to.  CPU usage is unlikely to add up to exactly 100%.

The SIZE and RSS fields don't count some parts of a process
including the page tables, kernel stack, struct thread_info, and
struct task_struct.  This is usually at least 20 KiB of memory
that is always resident.  SIZE is the virtual size of the process
(code+data+stack).

Processes marked <defunct> are dead processes (so-called
"zombies") that remain because their parent has not destroyed them
properly.  These processes will be destroyed by init(8) if the
parent process exits.

If the length of the username is greater than the width of the
display column, the username will be truncated.  See the -o and -O
formatting options to customize length.

Commands options such as ps -aux are not recommended as it is a
confusion of two different standards.  According to the POSIX and
Unix standards, the above command asks to display all processes
with a TTY (generally the commands users are running) plus all
processes owned by a user named x.  If that user doesn't exist,
then ps will assume you really meant "ps aux".


## PROCESS FLAGS

The sum of these values is displayed in the "F" column, which is
provided by the flags output specifier:

        1    forked but didn't exec
        4    used super-user privileges


## PROCESS STATE CODES

Here are the different values that the s, stat and state output
specifiers (header "STAT" or "S") will display to describe the
state of a process:

        D    uninterruptible sleep (usually I/O)
        I    idle kernel thread
        R    running or runnable (on run queue)
        S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an
             event to complete)
        T    stopped by job control signal
        t    stopped by debugger during the tracing
        W    paging (not valid since Linux 2.6)
        X    dead (should never be seen)
        Z    defunct (“zombie”) process, terminated
             but not reaped by its parent

For BSD formats and when the stat keyword is used, additional
characters may be displayed:

        <    high-priority (not nice to other users)
        N    low-priority (nice to other users)
        L    has pages locked into memory (for real-
             time and custom I/O)
        s    is a session leader
        l    is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD,
             like NPTL pthreads do)
        +    is in the foreground process group


## OBSOLETE SORT KEYS

These keys are used by the BSD O option (when it is used for
sorting).  The GNU --sort option doesn't use these keys, but the
specifiers described below in the STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS
section.  Note that the values used in sorting are the internal
values ps uses and not the "cooked" values used in some of the
output format fields (e.g., sorting on tty will sort into device
number, not according to the terminal name displayed).  Pipe ps
output into the sort(1) command if you want to sort the cooked
values.
