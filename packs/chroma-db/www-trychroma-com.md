CLI

Command-line tools for development

```
// configure client and collection for sparse embeddings (BM25, SPLADE)

// Add documents with sparse embeddings (BM25)
await collection.add({
  ids: ["id1", "id2"],
  documents: ["Document about databases", "ML tutorial"]
})

// Query with sparse vector
const sparseRank = Knn({ query: "ML", key: "sparse_embedding" });

// Build and execute search
const search = new Search()
  .rank(sparseRank)
  .limit(10)
  .select(K.DOCUMENT, K.SCORE);

const results = await collection.search(search);
```

Unlike legacy search systems, Chroma is a database you'll want to be on-call for.

✓

Auto-scales with usage

✓

No manual tuning

✓

Serverless pricing

Chroma takes full advantage of object storage with automatic query-aware data tiering and caching.

✓

Vectors are large: 1GB text → 15GB of vectors

✓

Memory is expensive: $5/GB/mo

✓

Object storage is not: $0.02/GB/mo

Enterprise

Chroma brings the security, compliance, education and operational model enterprises need with our Apache 2.0 architecture.

BYOC in your VPC, multi-cloud/multi-region replication, point-in-time-recovery ensure a resilient and scalable search system with the same 0-ops story as Cloud.
