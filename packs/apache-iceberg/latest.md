# Documentation

**Apache Iceberg is an open table format for huge analytic datasets.** Iceberg adds tables to compute engines including Spark, Trino, PrestoDB, Flink, Hive and Impala using a high-performance table format that works just like a SQL table.

### User experience

Iceberg avoids unpleasant surprises. Schema evolution works and won't inadvertently un-delete data. Users don't need to know about partitioning to get fast queries.

- Schema evolution supports add, drop, update, or rename, and has no side-effects
- Hidden partitioning prevents user mistakes that cause silently incorrect results or extremely slow queries
- Partition layout evolution can update the layout of a table as data volume or query patterns change
- Time travel enables reproducible queries that use exactly the same table snapshot, or lets users easily examine changes
- Version rollback allows users to quickly correct problems by resetting tables to a good state

### Reliability and performance

Iceberg was built for huge tables. Iceberg is used in production where a single table can contain tens of petabytes of data and even these huge tables can be read without a distributed SQL engine.

- Scan planning is fast -- a distributed SQL engine isn't needed to read a table or find files
- Advanced filtering -- data files are pruned with partition and column-level stats, using table metadata

Iceberg was designed to solve correctness problems in eventually-consistent cloud object stores.

- Works with any cloud store and reduces NN congestion when in HDFS, by avoiding listing and renames
- Serializable isolation -- table changes are atomic and readers never see partial or uncommitted changes
- Multiple concurrent writers use optimistic concurrency and will retry to ensure that compatible updates succeed, even when writes conflict

### Open standard

Iceberg has been designed and developed to be an open community standard with a specification to ensure compatibility across languages and implementations.

Apache Iceberg is open source, and is developed at the Apache Software Foundation.
