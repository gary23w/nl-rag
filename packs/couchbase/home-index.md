# Couchbase Documentation

*Couchbase is the modern database for enterprise applications.*

Couchbase is a distributed document database with a powerful search engine and in-built operational and analytical capabilities. It brings the power of NoSQL to the edge and provides fast, efficient bidirectional synchronization of data between the edge and the cloud.

Find the documentation, samples, and references to help you use Couchbase and build applications.
