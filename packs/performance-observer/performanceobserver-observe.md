# PerformanceObserver: observe() method

Baseline

Widely available

This feature is well established and works across many devices and browser versions. It’s been available across browsers since January 2020.

- See full compatibility

**Note:** This feature is available in Web Workers.

The **`observe()`** method of the **`PerformanceObserver`** interface is used to specify the set of performance entry types to observe.

See `PerformanceEntry.entryType` for a list of entry types and `PerformanceObserver.supportedEntryTypes` for a list of entry types the user agent supports.

When a matching performance entry is recorded, the performance observer's callback function—set when creating the `PerformanceObserver`—is invoked.

## Syntax

```js
observe(options)
```

### Parameters

**`options`**

An object with the following possible members:

**`buffered`**

A boolean flag to indicate whether buffered entries should be queued into the observer's buffer. Must be used only with the `type` option.

**`durationThreshold`**

A `DOMHighResTimeStamp` defining the threshold for `PerformanceEventTiming` entries. Defaults to 104ms and is rounded to the nearest of 8ms. Lowest possible threshold is 16ms. May not be used together with the `entryTypes` option.

**`entryTypes`**

An array of strings, each specifying one performance entry type to observe. May not be used together with the `type`, `buffered`, or `durationThreshold` options.

See `PerformanceEntry.entryType` for a list of valid performance entry type names. Unrecognized types are ignored, though the browser may output a warning message to the console to help developers debug their code. If no valid types are found, `observe()` has no effect.

**`type`**

A single string specifying exactly one performance entry type to observe. May not be used together with the `entryTypes` option.

### Return value

None (`undefined`).

## Examples

### Watching multiple performance entry types

This example creates a `PerformanceObserver` and watches for `"mark"` and `"measure"` entry types as specified by the `entryTypes` option given in the `observe()` method.

```js
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list, obj) => {
  list.getEntries().forEach((entry) => {
    // Process "mark" and "measure" events
  });
});
observer.observe({ entryTypes: ["mark", "measure"] });
```

### Watching a single performance entry type

The following example retrieves buffered events and subscribes to newer events for resource timing events (`PerformanceResourceTiming`) using the `buffered` and `type` configuration options. Whenever you need to configure the observer to use the `buffered` or `durationThreshold` option, use `type` instead of `entryType`. Collecting multiple types of performance entry types will not work otherwise.

```js
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list, obj) => {
  list.getEntries().forEach((entry) => {
    // Process "resource" events
  });
});
observer.observe({ type: "resource", buffered: true });
```
