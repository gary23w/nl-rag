## 8 Functions for Transforming Text

*Functions* allow you to do text processing in the makefile to compute the files to operate on or the commands to use in recipes. You use a function in a *function call*, where you give the name of the function and some text (the *arguments*) for the function to operate on. The result of the function’s processing is substituted into the makefile at the point of the call, just as a variable might be substituted.

Next: Functions for String Substitution and Analysis, Previous: Functions for Transforming Text, Up: Functions for Transforming Text   [Contents][Index]

### 8.1 Function Call Syntax

A function call resembles a variable reference. It can appear anywhere a variable reference can appear, and it is expanded using the same rules as variable references. A function call looks like this:

```
$(function arguments)
```

or like this:

```
${function arguments}
```

Here *function* is a function name; one of a short list of names that are part of `make`. You can also essentially create your own functions by using the `call` built-in function.

The *arguments* are the arguments of the function. They are separated from the function name by one or more spaces or tabs, and if there is more than one argument, then they are separated by commas. Such whitespace and commas are not part of an argument’s value. The delimiters which you use to surround the function call, whether parentheses or braces, can appear in an argument only in matching pairs; the other kind of delimiters may appear singly. If the arguments themselves contain other function calls or variable references, it is wisest to use the same kind of delimiters for all the references; write ‘$(subst a,b,$(x))’, not ‘$(subst a,b,${x})’. This is because it is clearer, and because only one type of delimiter is matched to find the end of the reference.

Each argument is expanded before the function is invoked, unless otherwise noted below. The substitution is done in the order in which the arguments appear.

#### Special Characters

When using characters that are special to `make` as function arguments, you may need to hide them. GNU `make` doesn’t support escaping characters with backslashes or other escape sequences; however, because arguments are split before they are expanded you can hide them by putting them into variables.

Characters you may need to hide include:

- Commas
- Initial whitespace in the first argument
- Unmatched open parenthesis or brace
- An open parenthesis or brace if you don’t want it to start a matched pair

For example, you can define variables `comma` and `space` whose values are isolated comma and space characters, then substitute these variables where such characters are wanted, like this:

```
comma:= ,
empty:=
space:= $(empty) $(empty)
foo:= a b c
bar:= $(subst $(space),$(comma),$(foo))
# bar is now ‘a,b,c’.
```

Here the `subst` function replaces each space with a comma, through the value of `foo`, and substitutes the result.

### 8.2 Functions for String Substitution and Analysis

Here are some functions that operate on strings:

**`$(subst *from*,*to*,*text*)` ¶**

Performs a textual replacement on the text *text*: each occurrence of *from* is replaced by *to*. The result is substituted for the function call. For example,

```
$(subst ee,EE,feet on the street)
```

produces the value ‘fEEt on the strEEt’.

**`$(patsubst *pattern*,*replacement*,*text*)` ¶**

Finds whitespace-separated words in *text* that match *pattern* and replaces them with *replacement*. Here *pattern* may contain a ‘%’ which acts as a wildcard, matching any number of any characters within a word. If *replacement* also contains a ‘%’, the ‘%’ is replaced by the text that matched the ‘%’ in *pattern*. Words that do not match the pattern are kept without change in the output. Only the first ‘%’ in the *pattern* and *replacement* is treated this way; any subsequent ‘%’ is unchanged.

‘%’ characters in `patsubst` function invocations can be quoted with preceding backslashes (‘\’). Backslashes that would otherwise quote ‘%’ characters can be quoted with more backslashes. Backslashes that quote ‘%’ characters or other backslashes are removed from the pattern before it is compared file names or has a stem substituted into it. Backslashes that are not in danger of quoting ‘%’ characters go unmolested. For example, the pattern the\%weird\\%pattern\\ has ‘the%weird\’ preceding the operative ‘%’ character, and ‘pattern\\’ following it. The final two backslashes are left alone because they cannot affect any ‘%’ character.

Whitespace between words is folded into single space characters; leading and trailing whitespace is discarded.

For example,

```
$(patsubst %.c,%.o,x.c.c bar.c)
```

produces the value ‘x.c.o bar.o’.

Substitution references (see Substitution References) are a simpler way to get the effect of the `patsubst` function:

```
$(var:pattern=replacement)
```

is equivalent to

```
$(patsubst pattern,replacement,$(var))
```

The second shorthand simplifies one of the most common uses of `patsubst`: replacing the suffix at the end of file names.

```
$(var:suffix=replacement)
```

is equivalent to

```
$(patsubst %suffix,%replacement,$(var))
```

For example, you might have a list of object files:

```
objects = foo.o bar.o baz.o
```

To get the list of corresponding source files, you could simply write:

```
$(objects:.o=.c)
```

instead of using the general form:

```
$(patsubst %.o,%.c,$(objects))
```

**`$(strip *string*)` ¶**

Removes leading and trailing whitespace from *string* and replaces each internal sequence of one or more whitespace characters with a single space. Thus, ‘$(strip a b c )’ results in ‘a b c’.

The function `strip` can be very useful when used in conjunction with conditionals. When comparing something with the empty string ‘’ using `ifeq` or `ifneq`, you usually want a string of just whitespace to match the empty string (see Conditional Parts of Makefiles).

Thus, the following may fail to have the desired results:

```
.PHONY: all
ifneq   "$(needs_made)" ""
all: $(needs_made)
else
all:;@echo 'Nothing to make!'
endif
```

Replacing the variable reference ‘$(needs_made)’ with the function call ‘$(strip $(needs_made))’ in the `ifneq` directive would make it more robust.

**`$(findstring *find*,*in*)` ¶**

Searches *in* for an occurrence of *find*. If it occurs, the value is *find*; otherwise, the value is empty. You can use this function in a conditional to test for the presence of a specific substring in a given string. Thus, the two examples,

```
$(findstring a,a b c)
$(findstring a,b c)
```

produce the values ‘a’ and ‘’ (the empty string), respectively. See Conditionals that Test Flags, for a practical application of `findstring`.

**`$(filter *pattern*…,*text*)`**

Returns all whitespace-separated words in *text* that *do* match any of the *pattern* words, removing any words that *do not* match. The patterns are written using ‘%’, just like the patterns used in the `patsubst` function above.

The `filter` function can be used to separate out different types of strings (such as file names) in a variable. For example:

```
sources := foo.c bar.c baz.s ugh.h
foo: $(sources)
        cc $(filter %.c %.s,$(sources)) -o foo
```

says that foo depends of foo.c, bar.c, baz.s and ugh.h but only foo.c, bar.c and baz.s should be specified in the command to the compiler.

**`$(filter-out *pattern*…,*text*)` ¶**

Returns all whitespace-separated words in *text* that *do not* match any of the *pattern* words, removing the words that *do* match one or more. This is the exact opposite of the `filter` function.

For example, given:

```
objects=main1.o foo.o main2.o bar.o
mains=main1.o main2.o
```

the following generates a list which contains all the object files not in ‘mains’:

```
$(filter-out $(mains),$(objects))
```

**`$(sort *list*)`**

Sorts the words of *list* in lexical order, removing duplicate words. The output is a list of words separated by single spaces. Thus,

```
$(sort foo bar lose)
```

returns the value ‘bar foo lose’.

Incidentally, since `sort` removes duplicate words, you can use it for this purpose even if you don’t care about the sort order.

**`$(word *n*,*text*)` ¶**

Returns the *n*th word of *text*. The legitimate values of *n* start from 1. If *n* is bigger than the number of words in *text*, the value is empty. For example,

```
$(word 2, foo bar baz)
```

returns ‘bar’.

**`$(wordlist *s*,*e*,*text*)` ¶**

Returns the list of words in *text* starting with word *s* and ending with word *e* (inclusive). The legitimate values of *s* start from 1; *e* may start from 0. If *s* is bigger than the number of words in *text*, the value is empty. If *e* is bigger than the number of words in *text*, words up to the end of *text* are returned. If *s* is greater than *e*, nothing is returned. For example,

```
$(wordlist 2, 3, foo bar baz)
```

returns ‘bar baz’.

**`$(words *text*)` ¶**

Returns the number of words in *text*. Thus, the last word of *text* is `$(word $(words *text*),*text*)`.

**`$(firstword *names*…)` ¶**

The argument *names* is regarded as a series of names, separated by whitespace. The value is the first name in the series. The rest of the names are ignored.

For example,

```
$(firstword foo bar)
```

produces the result ‘foo’. Although `$(firstword *text*)` is the same as `$(word 1,*text*)`, the `firstword` function is retained for its simplicity.

**`$(lastword *names*…)` ¶**

The argument *names* is regarded as a series of names, separated by whitespace. The value is the last name in the series.

For example,

```
$(lastword foo bar)
```

produces the result ‘bar’. Although `$(lastword *text*)` is the same as `$(word $(words *text*),*text*)`, the `lastword` function was added for its simplicity and better performance.

Here is a realistic example of the use of `subst` and `patsubst`. Suppose that a makefile uses the `VPATH` variable to specify a list of directories that `make` should search for prerequisite files (see `VPATH` Search Path for All Prerequisites). This example shows how to tell the C compiler to search for header files in the same list of directories.

The value of `VPATH` is a list of directories separated by colons, such as ‘src:../headers’. First, the `subst` function is used to change the colons to spaces:

```
$(subst :, ,$(VPATH))
```

This produces ‘src ../headers’. Then `patsubst` is used to turn each directory name into a ‘-I’ flag. These can be added to the value of the variable `CFLAGS`, which is passed automatically to the C compiler, like this:

```
override CFLAGS += $(patsubst %,-I%,$(subst :, ,$(VPATH)))
```

The effect is to append the text ‘-Isrc -I../headers’ to the previously given value of `CFLAGS`. The `override` directive is used so that the new value is assigned even if the previous value of `CFLAGS` was specified with a command argument (see The `override` Directive).

### 8.3 Functions for File Names

Several of the built-in expansion functions relate specifically to taking apart file names or lists of file names.

Each of the following functions performs a specific transformation on a file name. The argument of the function is regarded as a series of file names, separated by whitespace. (Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored.) Each file name in the series is transformed in the same way and the results are concatenated with single spaces between them.

**`$(dir *names*…)` ¶**

Extracts the directory-part of each file name in *names*. The directory-part of the file name is everything up through (and including) the last slash in it. If the file name contains no slash, the directory part is the string ‘./’. For example,

```
$(dir src/foo.c hacks)
```

produces the result ‘src/ ./’.

**`$(notdir *names*…)` ¶**

Extracts all but the directory-part of each file name in *names*. If the file name contains no slash, it is left unchanged. Otherwise, everything through the last slash is removed from it.

A file name that ends with a slash becomes an empty string. This is unfortunate, because it means that the result does not always have the same number of whitespace-separated file names as the argument had; but we do not see any other valid alternative.

For example,

```
$(notdir src/foo.c hacks)
```

produces the result ‘foo.c hacks’.

**`$(suffix *names*…)` ¶**

Extracts the suffix of each file name in *names*. If the file name contains a period, the suffix is everything starting with the last period. Otherwise, the suffix is the empty string. This frequently means that the result will be empty when *names* is not, and if *names* contains multiple file names, the result may contain fewer file names.

For example,

```
$(suffix src/foo.c src-1.0/bar.c hacks)
```

produces the result ‘.c .c’.

**`$(basename *names*…)` ¶**

Extracts all but the suffix of each file name in *names*. If the file name contains a period, the basename is everything starting up to (and not including) the last period. Periods in the directory part are ignored. If there is no period, the basename is the entire file name. For example,

```
$(basename src/foo.c src-1.0/bar hacks)
```

produces the result ‘src/foo src-1.0/bar hacks’.

**`$(addsuffix *suffix*,*names*…)` ¶**

The argument *names* is regarded as a series of names, separated by whitespace; *suffix* is used as a unit. The value of *suffix* is appended to the end of each individual name and the resulting larger names are concatenated with single spaces between them. For example,

```
$(addsuffix .c,foo bar)
```

produces the result ‘foo.c bar.c’.

**`$(addprefix *prefix*,*names*…)` ¶**

The argument *names* is regarded as a series of names, separated by whitespace; *prefix* is used as a unit. The value of *prefix* is prepended to the front of each individual name and the resulting larger names are concatenated with single spaces between them. For example,

```
$(addprefix src/,foo bar)
```

produces the result ‘src/foo src/bar’.

**`$(join *list1*,*list2*)` ¶**

Concatenates the two arguments word by word: the two first words (one from each argument) concatenated form the first word of the result, the two second words form the second word of the result, and so on. So the *n*th word of the result comes from the *n*th word of each argument. If one argument has more words that the other, the extra words are copied unchanged into the result.

For example, ‘$(join a b,.c .o)’ produces ‘a.c b.o’.

Whitespace between the words in the lists is not preserved; it is replaced with a single space.

This function can merge the results of the `dir` and `notdir` functions, to produce the original list of files which was given to those two functions.

**`$(wildcard *pattern*)` ¶**

The argument *pattern* is a file name pattern, typically containing wildcard characters (as in shell file name patterns). The result of `wildcard` is a space-separated list of the names of existing files that match the pattern. See Using Wildcard Characters in File Names.

**`$(realpath *names*…)` ¶**

For each file name in *names* return the canonical absolute name. A canonical name does not contain any `.` or `..` components, nor any repeated path separators (`/`) or symlinks. In case of a failure the empty string is returned. Consult the `realpath(3)` documentation for a list of possible failure causes.

**`$(abspath *names*…)` ¶**

For each file name in *names* return an absolute name that does not contain any `.` or `..` components, nor any repeated path separators (`/`). Note that, in contrast to `realpath` function, `abspath` does not resolve symlinks and does not require the file names to refer to an existing file or directory. Use the `wildcard` function to test for existence.

### 8.4 Functions for Conditionals

There are four functions that provide conditional expansion. A key aspect of these functions is that not all of the arguments are expanded initially. Only those arguments which need to be expanded, will be expanded.

**`$(if *condition*,*then-part*[,*else-part*])` ¶**

The `if` function provides support for conditional expansion in a functional context (as opposed to the GNU `make` makefile conditionals such as `ifeq` (see Syntax of Conditionals)).

The first argument, *condition*, first has all preceding and trailing whitespace stripped, then is expanded. If it expands to any non-empty string, then the condition is considered to be true. If it expands to an empty string, the condition is considered to be false.

If the condition is true then the second argument, *then-part*, is evaluated and this is used as the result of the evaluation of the entire `if` function.

If the condition is false then the third argument, *else-part*, is evaluated and this is the result of the `if` function. If there is no third argument, the `if` function evaluates to nothing (the empty string).

Note that only one of the *then-part* or the *else-part* will be evaluated, never both. Thus, either can contain side-effects (such as `shell` function calls, etc.)

**`$(or *condition1*[,*condition2*[,*condition3*…]])` ¶**

The `or` function provides a “short-circuiting” OR operation. Each argument is expanded, in order. If an argument expands to a non-empty string the processing stops and the result of the expansion is that string. If, after all arguments are expanded, all of them are false (empty), then the result of the expansion is the empty string.

**`$(and *condition1*[,*condition2*[,*condition3*…]])` ¶**

The `and` function provides a “short-circuiting” AND operation. Each argument is expanded, in order. If an argument expands to an empty string the processing stops and the result of the expansion is the empty string. If all arguments expand to a non-empty string then the result of the expansion is the expansion of the last argument.

**`$(intcmp *lhs*,*rhs*[,*lt-part*[,*eq-part*[,*gt-part*]]])` ¶**

The `intcmp` function provides support for numerical comparison of integers. This function has no counterpart among the GNU `make` makefile conditionals.

The left-hand side, *lhs*, and right-hand side, *rhs*, are expanded and parsed as integral numbers in base 10. Expansion of the remaining arguments is controlled by how the numerical left-hand side compares to the numerical right-hand side.

If there are no further arguments, then the function expands to empty if the left-hand side and right-hand side do not compare equal, or to their numerical value if they do compare equal.

Else if the left-hand side is strictly less than the right-hand side, the `intcmp` function evaluates to the expansion of the third argument, *lt-part*. If both sides compare equal, then the `intcmp` function evaluates to the expansion of the fourth argument, *eq-part*. If the left-hand side is strictly greater than the right-hand side, then the `intcmp` function evaluates to the expansion of the fifth argument, *gt-part*.

If *gt-part* is missing, it defaults to *eq-part*. If *eq-part* is missing, it defaults to the empty string. Thus both ‘$(intcmp 9,7,hello)’ and ‘$(intcmp 9,7,hello,world,)’ evaluate to the empty string, while ‘$(intcmp 9,7,hello,world)’ (notice the absence of a comma after `world`) evaluates to ‘world’.

Next: The `foreach` Function, Previous: Functions for Conditionals, Up: Functions for Transforming Text   [Contents][Index]

### 8.5 The `let` Function

The `let` function provides a means to limit the scope of a variable. The assignment of the named variables in a `let` expression is in effect only within the text provided by the `let` expression, and this assignment doesn’t impact that named variable in any outer scope.

Additionally, the `let` function enables list unpacking by assigning all unassigned values to the last named variable.

The syntax of the `let` function is:

```
$(let var [var ...],[list],text)
```

The first two arguments, *var* and *list*, are expanded before anything else is done; note that the last argument, *text*, is **not** expanded at the same time. Next, each word of the expanded value of *list* is bound to each of the variable names, *var*, in turn, with the final variable name being bound to the remainder of the expanded *list*. In other words, the first word of *list* is bound to the first variable *var*, the second word to the second variable *var*, and so on.

If there are more variable names in *var* than there are words in *list*, the remaining *var* variable names are set to the empty string. If there are fewer *var*s than words in *list* then the last *var* is set to all remaining words in *list*.

The variables in *var* are assigned as simply-expanded variables during the execution of `let`. See The Two Flavors of Variables.

After all variables are thus bound, *text* is expanded to provide the result of the `let` function.

For example, this macro reverses the order of the words in the list that it is given as its first argument:

```
reverse = $(let first rest,$1,\
            $(if $(rest),$(call reverse,$(rest)) )$(first))

all: ; @echo $(call reverse,d c b a)
```

will print `a b c d`. When first called, `let` will expand *$1* to `d c b a`. It will then assign *first* to `d` and assign *rest* to `c b a`. It will then expand the if-statement, where `$(rest)` is not empty so we recursively invoke the *reverse* function with the value of *rest* which is now `c b a`. The recursive invocation of `let` assigns *first* to `c` and *rest* to `b a`. The recursion continues until `let` is called with just a single value, `a`. Here *first* is `a` and *rest* is empty, so we do not recurse but simply expand `$(first)` to `a` and return, which adds `b`, etc.

After the *reverse* call is complete, the *first* and *rest* variables are no longer set. If variables by those names existed beforehand, they are not affected by the expansion of the `reverse` macro.

Next: The `file` Function, Previous: The `let` Function, Up: Functions for Transforming Text   [Contents][Index]

### 8.6 The `foreach` Function

The `foreach` function is similar to the `let` function, but very different from other functions. It causes one piece of text to be used repeatedly, each time with a different substitution performed on it. The `foreach` function resembles the `for` command in the shell `sh` and the `foreach` command in the C-shell `csh`.

The syntax of the `foreach` function is:

```
$(foreach var,list,text)
```

The first two arguments, *var* and *list*, are expanded before anything else is done; note that the last argument, *text*, is **not** expanded at the same time. Then for each word of the expanded value of *list*, the variable named by the expanded value of *var* is set to that word, and *text* is expanded. Presumably *text* contains references to that variable, so its expansion will be different each time.

The result is that *text* is expanded as many times as there are whitespace-separated words in *list*. The multiple expansions of *text* are concatenated, with spaces between them, to make the result of `foreach`.

This simple example sets the variable ‘files’ to the list of all files in the directories in the list ‘dirs’:

```
dirs := a b c d
files := $(foreach dir,$(dirs),$(wildcard $(dir)/*))
```

Here *text* is ‘$(wildcard $(dir)/*)’. The first repetition finds the value ‘a’ for `dir`, so it produces the same result as ‘$(wildcard a/*)’; the second repetition produces the result of ‘$(wildcard b/*)’; and the third, that of ‘$(wildcard c/*)’.

This example has the same result (except for setting ‘dirs’) as the following example:

```
files := $(wildcard a/* b/* c/* d/*)
```

When *text* is complicated, you can improve readability by giving it a name, with an additional variable:

```
find_files = $(wildcard $(dir)/*)
dirs := a b c d
files := $(foreach dir,$(dirs),$(find_files))
```

Here we use the variable `find_files` this way. We use plain ‘=’ to define a recursively-expanding variable, so that its value contains an actual function call to be re-expanded under the control of `foreach`; a simply-expanded variable would not do, since `wildcard` would be called only once at the time of defining `find_files`.

Like the `let` function, the `foreach` function has no permanent effect on the variable *var*; its value and flavor after the `foreach` function call are the same as they were beforehand. The other values which are taken from *list* are in effect only temporarily, during the execution of `foreach`. The variable *var* is a simply-expanded variable during the execution of `foreach`. If *var* was undefined before the `foreach` function call, it is undefined after the call. See The Two Flavors of Variables.

You must take care when using complex variable expressions that result in variable names because many strange things are valid variable names, but are probably not what you intended. For example,

```
files := $(foreach Esta-escrito-en-espanol!,b c ch,$(find_files))
```

might be useful if the value of `find_files` references the variable whose name is ‘Esta-escrito-en-espanol!’ (es un nombre bastante largo, no?), but it is more likely to be a mistake.

Next: The `call` Function, Previous: The `foreach` Function, Up: Functions for Transforming Text   [Contents][Index]

### 8.7 The `file` Function

The `file` function allows the makefile to write to or read from a file. Two modes of writing are supported: overwrite, where the text is written to the beginning of the file and any existing content is lost, and append, where the text is written to the end of the file, preserving the existing content. In both cases the file is created if it does not exist. It is a fatal error if the file cannot be opened for writing, or if the write operation fails. The `file` function expands to the empty string when writing to a file.

When reading from a file, the `file` function expands to the verbatim contents of the file, except that the final newline (if there is one) will be stripped. Attempting to read from a non-existent file expands to the empty string.

The syntax of the `file` function is:

```
$(file op filename[,text])
```

When the `file` function is evaluated all its arguments are expanded first, then the file indicated by *filename* will be opened in the mode described by *op*.

The operator *op* can be `>` to indicate the file will be overwritten with new content, `>>` to indicate the current contents of the file will be appended to, or `<` to indicate the contents of the file will be read in. The *filename* specifies the file to be written to or read from. There may optionally be whitespace between the operator and the file name.

When reading files, it is an error to provide a *text* value.

When writing files, *text* will be written to the file. If *text* does not already end in a newline a final newline will be written (even if *text* is the empty string). If the *text* argument is not given at all, nothing will be written.

For example, the `file` function can be useful if your build system has a limited command line size and your recipe runs a command that can accept arguments from a file as well. Many commands use the convention that an argument prefixed with an `@` specifies a file containing more arguments. Then you might write your recipe in this way:

```
program: $(OBJECTS)
        $(file >$@.in,$^)
        $(CMD) $(CMDFLAGS) @$@.in
        @rm $@.in
```

If the command required each argument to be on a separate line of the input file, you might write your recipe like this:

```
program: $(OBJECTS)
        $(file >$@.in) $(foreach O,$^,$(file >>$@.in,$O))
        $(CMD) $(CMDFLAGS) @$@.in
        @rm $@.in
```

Next: The `value` Function, Previous: The `file` Function, Up: Functions for Transforming Text   [Contents][Index]

### 8.8 The `call` Function

The `call` function is unique in that it can be used to create new parameterized functions. You can write a complex expression as the value of a variable, then use `call` to expand it with different values.

The syntax of the `call` function is:

```
$(call variable,param,param,…)
```

When `make` expands this function, it assigns each *param* to temporary variables `$(1)`, `$(2)`, etc. The variable `$(0)` will contain *variable*. There is no maximum number of parameter arguments. There is no minimum, either, but it doesn’t make sense to use `call` with no parameters.

Then *variable* is expanded as a `make` variable in the context of these temporary assignments. Thus, any reference to `$(1)` in the value of *variable* will resolve to the first *param* in the invocation of `call`.

Note that *variable* is the *name* of a variable, not a *reference* to that variable. Therefore you would not normally use a ‘$’ or parentheses when writing it. (You can, however, use a variable reference in the name if you want the name not to be a constant.)

If *variable* is the name of a built-in function, the built-in function is always invoked (even if a `make` variable by that name also exists).

The `call` function expands the *param* arguments before assigning them to temporary variables. This means that *variable* values containing references to built-in functions that have special expansion rules, like `foreach` or `if`, may not work as you expect.

Some examples may make this clearer.

This macro simply reverses its arguments:

```
reverse = $(2) $(1)

foo = $(call reverse,a,b)
```

Here `foo` will contain ‘b a’.

This one is slightly more interesting: it defines a macro to search for the first instance of a program in `PATH`:

```
pathsearch = $(firstword $(wildcard $(addsuffix /$(1),$(subst :, ,$(PATH)))))

LS := $(call pathsearch,ls)
```

Now the variable `LS` contains `/bin/ls` or similar.

The `call` function can be nested. Each recursive invocation gets its own local values for `$(1)`, etc. that mask the values of higher-level `call`. For example, here is an implementation of a *map* function:

```
map = $(foreach a,$(2),$(call $(1),$(a)))
```

Now you can `map` a function that normally takes only one argument, such as `origin`, to multiple values in one step:

```
o = $(call map,origin,o map MAKE)
```

and end up with `o` containing something like ‘file file default’.

A final caution: be careful when adding whitespace to the arguments to `call`. As with other functions, any whitespace contained in the second and subsequent arguments is kept; this can cause strange effects. It’s generally safest to remove all extraneous whitespace when providing parameters to `call`.

### 8.9 The `value` Function

The `value` function provides a way for you to use the value of a variable *without* having it expanded. Please note that this does not undo expansions which have already occurred; for example if you create a simply expanded variable its value is expanded during the definition; in that case the `value` function will return the same result as using the variable directly.

The syntax of the `value` function is:

```
$(value variable)
```

Note that *variable* is the *name* of a variable, not a *reference* to that variable. Therefore you would not normally use a ‘$’ or parentheses when writing it. (You can, however, use a variable reference in the name if you want the name not to be a constant.)

The result of this function is a string containing the value of *variable*, without any expansion occurring. For example, in this makefile:

```
FOO = $PATH

all:
        @echo $(FOO)
        @echo $(value FOO)
```

The first output line would be `ATH`, since the “$P” would be expanded as a `make` variable, while the second output line would be the current value of your `$PATH` environment variable, since the `value` function avoided the expansion.

The `value` function is most often used in conjunction with the `eval` function (see The `eval` Function).

### 8.10 The `eval` Function

The `eval` function is very special: it allows you to define new makefile constructs that are not constant; which are the result of evaluating other variables and functions. The argument to the `eval` function is expanded, then the results of that expansion are parsed as makefile syntax. The expanded results can define new `make` variables, targets, implicit or explicit rules, etc.

The result of the `eval` function is always the empty string; thus, it can be placed virtually anywhere in a makefile without causing syntax errors.

It’s important to realize that the `eval` argument is expanded *twice*; first by the `eval` function, then the results of that expansion are expanded again when they are parsed as makefile syntax. This means you may need to provide extra levels of escaping for “$” characters when using `eval`. The `value` function (see The `value` Function) can sometimes be useful in these situations, to circumvent unwanted expansions.

Here is an example of how `eval` can be used; this example combines a number of concepts and other functions. Although it might seem overly complex to use `eval` in this example, rather than just writing out the rules, consider two things: first, the template definition (in `PROGRAM_template`) could need to be much more complex than it is here; and second, you might put the complex, “generic” part of this example into another makefile, then include it in all the individual makefiles. Now your individual makefiles are quite straightforward.

```
PROGRAMS    = server client

server_OBJS = server.o server_priv.o server_access.o
server_LIBS = priv protocol

client_OBJS = client.o client_api.o client_mem.o
client_LIBS = protocol

# Everything after this is generic

.PHONY: all
all: $(PROGRAMS)

define PROGRAM_template =
 $(1): $$($(1)_OBJS) $$($(1)_LIBS:%=-l%)
 ALL_OBJS   += $$($(1)_OBJS)
endef

$(foreach prog,$(PROGRAMS),$(eval $(call PROGRAM_template,$(prog))))

$(PROGRAMS):
        $(LINK.o) $^ $(LDLIBS) -o $@

clean:
        rm -f $(ALL_OBJS) $(PROGRAMS)
```

### 8.11 The `origin` Function

The `origin` function is unlike most other functions in that it does not operate on the values of variables; it tells you something *about* a variable. Specifically, it tells you where it came from.

The syntax of the `origin` function is:

```
$(origin variable)
```

Note that *variable* is the *name* of a variable to inquire about, not a *reference* to that variable. Therefore you would not normally use a ‘$’ or parentheses when writing it. (You can, however, use a variable reference in the name if you want the name not to be a constant.)

The result of this function is a string telling you how the variable *variable* was defined:

**‘undefined’**

if *variable* was never defined.

**‘default’**

if *variable* has a default definition, as is usual with `CC` and so on. See Variables Used by Implicit Rules. Note that if you have redefined a default variable, the `origin` function will return the origin of the later definition.

**‘environment’**

if *variable* was inherited from the environment provided to `make`.

**‘environment override’**

if *variable* was inherited from the environment provided to `make`, and is overriding a setting for *variable* in the makefile as a result of the ‘-e’ option (see Summary of Options).

**‘file’**

if *variable* was defined in a makefile.

**‘command line’**

if *variable* was defined on the command line.

**‘override’**

if *variable* was defined with an `override` directive in a makefile (see The `override` Directive).

**‘automatic’**

if *variable* is an automatic variable defined for the execution of the recipe for each rule (see Automatic Variables).

This information is primarily useful (other than for your curiosity) to determine if you want to believe the value of a variable. For example, suppose you have a makefile foo that includes another makefile bar. You want a variable `bletch` to be defined in bar if you run the command ‘make -f bar’, even if the environment contains a definition of `bletch`. However, if foo defined `bletch` before including bar, you do not want to override that definition. This could be done by using an `override` directive in foo, giving that definition precedence over the later definition in bar; unfortunately, the `override` directive would also override any command line definitions. So, bar could include:

```
ifdef bletch
ifeq "$(origin bletch)" "environment"
bletch = barf, gag, etc.
endif
endif
```

If `bletch` has been defined from the environment, this will redefine it.

If you want to override a previous definition of `bletch` if it came from the environment, even under ‘-e’, you could instead write:

```
ifneq "$(findstring environment,$(origin bletch))" ""
bletch = barf, gag, etc.
endif
```

Here the redefinition takes place if ‘$(origin bletch)’ returns either ‘environment’ or ‘environment override’. See Functions for String Substitution and Analysis.

### 8.12 The `flavor` Function

The `flavor` function, like the `origin` function, does not operate on the values of variables but rather it tells you something *about* a variable. Specifically, it tells you the flavor of a variable (see The Two Flavors of Variables).

The syntax of the `flavor` function is:

```
$(flavor variable)
```

Note that *variable* is the *name* of a variable to inquire about, not a *reference* to that variable. Therefore you would not normally use a ‘$’ or parentheses when writing it. (You can, however, use a variable reference in the name if you want the name not to be a constant.)

The result of this function is a string that identifies the flavor of the variable *variable*:

**‘undefined’**

if *variable* was never defined.

**‘recursive’**

if *variable* is a recursively expanded variable.

**‘simple’**

if *variable* is a simply expanded variable.

### 8.13 Functions That Control Make

These functions control the way make runs. Generally, they are used to provide information to the user of the makefile or to cause make to stop if some sort of environmental error is detected.

**`$(error *text*…)` ¶**

Generates a fatal error where the message is *text*. Note that the error is generated whenever this function is evaluated. So, if you put it inside a recipe or on the right side of a recursive variable assignment, it won’t be evaluated until later. The *text* will be expanded before the error is generated.

For example,

```
ifdef ERROR1
$(error error is $(ERROR1))
endif
```

will generate a fatal error during the read of the makefile if the `make` variable `ERROR1` is defined. Or,

```
ERR = $(error found an error!)

.PHONY: err
err: ; $(ERR)
```

will generate a fatal error while `make` is running, if the `err` target is invoked.

**`$(warning *text*…)` ¶**

This function works similarly to the `error` function, above, except that `make` doesn’t exit. Instead, *text* is expanded and the resulting message is displayed, but processing of the makefile continues.

The result of the expansion of this function is the empty string.

**`$(info *text*…)` ¶**

This function does nothing more than print its (expanded) argument(s) to standard output. No makefile name or line number is added. The result of the expansion of this function is the empty string.

### 8.14 The `shell` Function

The `shell` function is unlike any other function other than the `wildcard` function (see The Function `wildcard`) in that it communicates with the world outside of `make`.

The `shell` function provides for `make` the same facility that backquotes (‘`’) provide in most shells: it does *command expansion*. This means that it takes as an argument a shell command and expands to the output of the command. The only processing `make` does on the result is to convert each newline (or carriage-return / newline pair) to a single space. If there is a trailing (carriage-return and) newline it will simply be removed.

The commands run by calls to the `shell` function are run when the function calls are expanded (see How `make` Reads a Makefile). Because this function involves spawning a new shell, you should carefully consider the performance implications of using the `shell` function within recursively expanded variables vs. simply expanded variables (see The Two Flavors of Variables).

An alternative to the `shell` function is the ‘!=’ assignment operator; it provides a similar behavior but has subtle differences (see Setting Variables). The ‘!=’ assignment operator is included in newer POSIX standards.

After the `shell` function or ‘!=’ assignment operator is used, its exit status is placed in the `.SHELLSTATUS` variable.

Here are some examples of the use of the `shell` function:

```
contents := $(shell cat foo)
```

sets `contents` to the contents of the file foo, with a space (rather than a newline) separating each line.

```
files := $(shell echo *.c)
```

sets `files` to the expansion of ‘*.c’. Unless `make` is using a very strange shell, this has the same result as ‘$(wildcard *.c)’ (as long as at least one ‘.c’ file exists).

All variables that are marked as `export` will also be passed to the shell started by the `shell` function. It is possible to create a variable expansion loop: consider this makefile:

```
export HI = $(shell echo hi)
all: ; @echo $$HI
```

When `make` wants to run the recipe it must add the variable *HI* to the environment; to do so it must be expanded. The value of this variable requires an invocation of the `shell` function, and to invoke it we must create its environment. Since *HI* is exported, we need to expand it to create its environment. And so on. In this obscure case `make` will use the value of the variable from the environment provided to `make`, or else the empty string if there was none, rather than looping or issuing an error. This is often what you want; for example:

```
export PATH = $(shell echo /usr/local/bin:$$PATH)
```

However, it would be simpler and more efficient to use a simply-expanded variable here (‘:=’) in the first place.

### 8.15 The `guile` Function

If GNU `make` is built with support for GNU Guile as an embedded extension language then the `guile` function will be available. The `guile` function takes one argument which is first expanded by `make` in the normal fashion, then passed to the GNU Guile evaluator. The result of the evaluator is converted into a string and used as the expansion of the `guile` function in the makefile. See GNU Guile Integration for details on writing extensions to `make` in Guile.

You can determine whether GNU Guile support is available by checking the `.FEATURES` variable for the word *guile*.
