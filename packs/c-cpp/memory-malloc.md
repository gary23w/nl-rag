memory

| Defined in header `<stdlib.h>` |   |   |
|---|---|---|
| void *malloc( size_t size ); |   |   |
|   |   |   |

Allocates `size` bytes of uninitialized storage.

If allocation succeeds, returns a pointer that is suitably aligned for any object type with fundamental alignment.

If `size` is zero, the behavior of `malloc` is implementation-defined. For example, a null pointer may be returned. Alternatively, a non-null pointer may be returned; but such a pointer should not be dereferenced, and should be passed to free to avoid memory leaks.

| `malloc` is thread-safe: it behaves as though only accessing the memory locations visible through its argument, and not any static storage. A previous call to free, free_sized, and free_aligned_sized(since C23) or realloc that deallocates a region of memory *synchronizes-with* a call to `malloc` that allocates the same or a part of the same region of memory. This synchronization occurs after any access to the memory by the deallocating function and before any access to the memory by `malloc`. There is a single total order of all allocation and deallocation functions operating on each particular region of memory. | (since C11) |

### Parameters

| size | - | number of bytes to allocate |
|---|---|---|

### Return value

On success, returns the pointer to the beginning of newly allocated memory. To avoid a memory leak, the returned pointer must be deallocated with free() or realloc().

On failure, returns a null pointer.

### Example

Run this code

```mw
#include <stdio.h>   
#include <stdlib.h> 

int main(void) 
{
    int *p1 = malloc(4*sizeof(int));  // allocates enough for an array of 4 int
    int *p2 = malloc(sizeof(int[4])); // same, naming the type directly
    int *p3 = malloc(4*sizeof *p3);   // same, without repeating the type name

    if(p1) {
        for(int n=0; n<4; ++n) // populate the array
            p1[n] = n*n;
        for(int n=0; n<4; ++n) // print it back out
            printf("p1[%d] == %d\n", n, p1[n]);
    }

    free(p1);
    free(p2);
    free(p3);
}
```

Output:

```mw
p1[0] == 0
p1[1] == 1
p1[2] == 4
p1[3] == 9
```
