# Web Serial API

Limited availability

This feature is not Baseline because it does not work in some of the most widely-used browsers.

**Secure context:** This feature is available only in secure contexts (HTTPS), in some or all supporting browsers.

**Note:** This feature is available in Dedicated Web Workers.

The **Web Serial API** provides a way for websites to read from and write to serial devices. These devices may be connected via a serial port, or be USB or Bluetooth devices that emulate a serial port.

## Concepts and Usage

The Web Serial API provides the ability to connect to devices that communicate via a serial protocol. This includes USB and Bluetooth devices that connect over USB or Bluetooth but expose a virtual serial port to the operating system (via USB CDC-ACM or Bluetooth SPP).

Note that these are distinct from devices accessed via the WebUSB API, — which provides raw access to USB devices that have not been claimed by an OS driver — or input devices that use the USB HID class, which are accessible via the WebHID API.

Examples of serial devices include 3D printers, ESP32 devices, and microcontrollers such as the BBC micro:bit board.

## Interfaces

**`Serial`**

Provides attributes and methods for finding and connecting to serial ports from a web page.

**`SerialPort`**

Provides access to a serial port on the host device.

## Extensions to other interfaces

**`Navigator.serial` Read only**

Returns a `Serial` object, which represents the main thread entry point into the Web Serial API.

**`WorkerNavigator.serial` Read only**

Returns a `Serial` object, which represents the worker entry point into the Web Serial API.

## HTTP headers

**`Permissions-Policy` `serial` directive**

Controls whether the current document is allowed to use the Web Serial API to communicate with serial devices, either directly connected via a serial port, or via USB or Bluetooth devices emulating a serial port.

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate some of the functionality provided by the Web Serial API.

### Checking for available ports

The following example shows how to check for available ports and allows the user to grant it permission to access additional ports.

The `connect` and `disconnect` events let sites react when a device is connected or disconnected from the system. The `getPorts()` method is then called to see connected ports that the site already has access to.

If the site doesn't have access to any connected ports it has to wait until it has user activation to proceed. In this example, we use a `click` event handler on a button for this task. A filter is passed to `requestPort()` with a USB vendor ID in order to limit the set of devices shown to the user to only USB devices built by a particular manufacturer.

```js
navigator.serial.addEventListener("connect", (e) => {
  // Connect to `e.target` or add it to a list of available ports.
});

navigator.serial.addEventListener("disconnect", (e) => {
  // Remove `e.target` from the list of available ports.
});

navigator.serial.getPorts().then((ports) => {
  // Initialize the list of available ports with `ports` on page load.
});

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const usbVendorId = 0xabcd;
  navigator.serial
    .requestPort({ filters: [{ usbVendorId }] })
    .then((port) => {
      // Connect to `port` or add it to the list of available ports.
    })
    .catch((e) => {
      // The user didn't select a port.
    });
});
```

### Reading data from a port

The following example shows how to read data from a port. The outer loop handles non-fatal errors, creating a new reader until a fatal error is encountered and `SerialPort.readable` becomes `null`.

```js
while (port.readable) {
  const reader = port.readable.getReader();
  try {
    while (true) {
      const { value, done } = await reader.read();
      if (done) {
        // |reader| has been canceled.
        break;
      }
      // Do something with |value|...
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle |error|...
  } finally {
    reader.releaseLock();
  }
}
```
