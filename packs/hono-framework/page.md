# Hono 

Hono - ***means flame🔥 in Japanese*** - is a small, simple, and ultrafast web framework built on Web Standards. It works on any JavaScript runtime: Cloudflare Workers, Fastly Compute, Deno, Bun, Vercel, Netlify, AWS Lambda, Lambda@Edge, and Node.js.

Fast, but not only fast.

ts

```ts
import { Hono
 } from 'hono'
const app
 = new Hono
()

app
.get
('/', (c
) => c
.text
('Hono!'))

export default app
```

## Quick Start 

Just run this:

sh

```sh
npm create hono@latest
```

sh

```sh
yarn create hono
```

sh

```sh
pnpm create hono@latest
```

sh

```sh
bun create hono@latest
```

sh

```sh
deno init --npm hono@latest
```

## Features 

- **Ultrafast** 🚀 - The router `RegExpRouter` is really fast. Not using linear loops. Fast.
- **Lightweight** 🪶 - The `hono/tiny` preset is under 14kB. Hono has zero dependencies and uses only the Web Standards.
- **Multi-runtime** 🌍 - Works on Cloudflare Workers, Fastly Compute, Deno, Bun, AWS Lambda, or Node.js. The same code runs on all platforms.
- **Batteries Included** 🔋 - Hono has built-in middleware, custom middleware, third-party middleware, and helpers. Batteries included.
- **Delightful DX** 😃 - Super clean APIs. First-class TypeScript support. Now, we've got "Types".

## Use-cases 

Hono is a simple web application framework similar to Express, without a frontend. But it runs on CDN Edges and allows you to construct larger applications when combined with middleware. Here are some examples of use-cases.

- Building Web APIs
- Proxy of backend servers
- Front of CDN
- Edge application
- Base server for a library
- Full-stack application

## Who is using Hono? 

| Project | Platform | What for? |
|---|---|---|
| cdnjs | Cloudflare Workers | A free and open-source CDN service. *Hono is used for the API server*. |
| Cloudflare D1 | Cloudflare Workers | Serverless SQL databases. *Hono is used for the internal API server*. |
| Cloudflare Workers KV | Cloudflare Workers | Serverless key-value database. *Hono is used for the internal API server*. |
| BaseAI | Local AI Server | Serverless AI agent pipes with memory. An open-source agentic AI framework for web. *API server with Hono*. |
| Unkey | Cloudflare Workers | An open-source API authentication and authorization. *Hono is used for the API server*. |
| OpenStatus | Bun | An open-source website & API monitoring platform. *Hono is used for the API server*. |
| Deno Benchmarks | Deno | A secure TypeScript runtime built on V8. *Hono is used for benchmarking*. |
| Clerk | Cloudflare Workers | An open-source User Management Platform. *Hono is used for the API server*. |

## Ultrafast 

**Hono is the fastest**, compared to other routers for Cloudflare Workers.

```vp
Hono x 402,820 ops/sec ±4.78% (80 runs sampled)
itty-router x 212,598 ops/sec ±3.11% (87 runs sampled)
sunder x 297,036 ops/sec ±4.76% (77 runs sampled)
worktop x 197,345 ops/sec ±2.40% (88 runs sampled)
Fastest is Hono
✨  Done in 28.06s.
```

See more benchmarks.

## Lightweight 

**Hono is so small**. With the `hono/tiny` preset, its size is **under 14KB** when minified. There are many middleware and adapters, but they are bundled only when used. For context, the size of Express is 572KB.

```vp
$ npx wrangler dev --minify ./src/index.ts
 ⛅️ wrangler 2.20.0

⬣ Listening at http://0.0.0.0:8787

- http://192.168.128.165:8787

```

## Multiple routers 

**Hono has multiple routers**.

**RegExpRouter** is the fastest router in the JavaScript world. It matches the route using a single large Regex created before dispatch. With **SmartRouter**, it supports all route patterns.

**LinearRouter** registers the routes very quickly, so it's suitable for an environment that initializes applications every time. **PatternRouter** simply adds and matches the pattern, making it small.

See more information about routes.

## Web Standards 

Thanks to the use of the **Web Standards**, Hono works on a lot of platforms.

- Cloudflare Workers
- Fastly Compute
- Deno
- Bun
- Vercel
- AWS Lambda
- Lambda@Edge
- Others

And by using a Node.js adapter, Hono works on Node.js.

See more information about Web Standards.

## Middleware & Helpers 

**Hono has many middleware and helpers**. This makes "Write Less, do more" a reality.

Out of the box, Hono provides middleware and helpers for:

- Basic Authentication
- Bearer Authentication
- Body Limit
- Cache
- Compress
- Context Storage
- Cookie
- CORS
- ETag
- html
- JSX
- JWT Authentication
- Logger
- Language
- Pretty JSON
- Secure Headers
- SSG
- Streaming
- GraphQL Server
- Firebase Authentication
- Sentry
- Others!

For example, adding ETag and request logging only takes a few lines of code with Hono:

ts

```ts
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { etag } from 'hono/etag'
import { logger } from 'hono/logger'

const app = new Hono()
app.use(etag(), logger())
```

See more information about Middleware.

## Developer Experience 

Hono provides a delightful "**Developer Experience**".

Easy access to Request/Response thanks to the `Context` object. Moreover, Hono is written in TypeScript. Hono has "**Types**".

For example, the path parameters will be literal types.

(A screenshot showing Hono having proper literal typing when URL parameters. The URL "/entry/:date/:id" allows for request parameters to be "date" or "id")

And, the Validator and Hono Client `hc` enable the RPC mode. In RPC mode, you can use your favorite validator such as Zod and easily share server-side API specs with the client and build type-safe applications.

See Hono Stacks.
