# MediaRecorder: start() method

Baseline

Widely available

This feature is well established and works across many devices and browser versions. It’s been available across browsers since April 2021.

The **`start()`** method of the `MediaRecorder` interface begins recording media into one or more `Blob` objects.

You can record the entire duration of the media into a single `Blob` (or until you call `requestData()`), or you can specify the number of milliseconds to record at a time. Then, each time that amount of media has been recorded, an event will be delivered to let you act upon the recorded media, while a new `Blob` is created to record the next slice of the media.

Assuming the `MediaRecorder`'s `state` is `inactive`, `start()` sets the `state` to `recording`, then begins capturing media from the input stream. A `Blob` is created and the data is collected in it until the time slice period elapses or the source media ends. Each time a `Blob` is filled up to that point (the timeslice duration or the end-of-media, if no slice duration was provided), a `dataavailable` event is sent to the `MediaRecorder` with the recorded data. If the source is still playing, a new `Blob` is created and recording continues into that, and so forth.

When the source stream ends, `state` is set to `inactive` and data gathering stops. A final `dataavailable` event is sent to the `MediaRecorder`, followed by a `stop` event.

**Note:** If the browser is unable to start recording or continue recording, it will raise an `error` event, followed by a `dataavailable` event containing the `Blob` it has gathered, followed by the `stop` event.

## Syntax

```js
start()
start(timeslice)
```

### Parameters

**`timeslice` Optional**

The number of milliseconds to record into each `Blob`. If this parameter isn't included, the entire media duration is recorded into a single `Blob` unless the `requestData()` method is called to obtain the `Blob` and trigger the creation of a new `Blob` into which the media continues to be recorded.

**Note:** Like other time values in web APIs, `timeslice` is not exact and the real intervals may be slightly longer due to other pending tasks before the creation of the next blob.

### Return value

None (`undefined`).

### Exceptions

Errors that can be detected immediately are thrown as DOM exceptions. All other errors are reported through `error` events sent to the `MediaRecorder` object. You can implement the `onerror` event handler to respond to these errors.

**`InvalidStateError` `DOMException`**

Thrown if the `MediaRecorder` is not in the `inactive` state; you cannot start recording media if it is already being recorded. See the `state` property.

**`NotSupportedError` `DOMException`**

Thrown if:

- The media stream you are attempting to record is inactive.
- One or more of the stream's tracks is in a format that cannot be recorded using the current configuration
- The `videoKeyFrameIntervalDuration` and `videoKeyFrameIntervalCount` parameter are both specified when creating the `MediaRecorder`.

**`SecurityError` `DOMException`**

Thrown if the `MediaStream` is configured to disallow recording. This may be the case, for example, with sources obtained using `getUserMedia()` when the user denies permission to use an input device. This exception may also be delivered as an `error` event if the security options for the source media change after recording begins.

## Examples

```js
record.onclick = () => {
  mediaRecorder.start();
  console.log("recorder started");
};
```
