# Environment variable

An **environment variable** is a user-definable value that can affect the way running processes will behave on a computer. Environment variables are part of the environment in which a process runs. For example, a running process can query the value of the TEMP environment variable to discover a suitable location to store temporary files, or the HOME or USERPROFILE variable to find the directory structure owned by the user running the process.

They were introduced in their modern form in 1979 with Version 7 Unix, so are included in all Unix operating system flavors and variants from that point onward including Linux and macOS. From PC DOS 2.0 in 1982, all succeeding Microsoft operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, and OS/2 also have included them as a feature, although with somewhat different syntax, usage and standard variable names.


## Design

In all Unix and Unix-like systems, as well as on Windows, each process has its own separate set of environment variables. By default, when a process is created, it inherits a duplicate run-time environment of its parent process, except for explicit changes made by the parent when it creates the child. At the API level, these changes must be done between running `fork` and `exec`. Alternatively, from command shells such as bash, a user can change environment variables for a particular command invocation by indirectly invoking it via `env` or using the `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=VALUE <command>` notation. A running program can access the values of environment variables for configuration purposes.

Shell scripts and batch files use environment variables to communicate data and preferences to child processes. They can also be used to store temporary values for reference later in a shell script. However, in Unix, non-exported variables are preferred for this as they do not leak outside the process.

In Unix, an environment variable that is changed in a script or compiled program will only affect that process and possibly child processes. The parent process and any unrelated processes will not be affected. Similarly, changing or removing a variable's value inside a DOS or Windows batch file will change the variable for the duration of `COMMAND.COM`or `CMD.EXE`'s existence, respectively.

In Unix, the environment variables are normally initialized during system startup by the system init startup scripts, and hence inherited by all other processes in the system. Users can, and often do, augment them in the profile script for the command shell they are using. In Microsoft Windows, each environment variable's default value is stored in the Windows Registry or set in the `AUTOEXEC.BAT` file.

On Unix, a setuid program is given an environment chosen by its caller, but it runs with different authority from its caller. The dynamic linker will usually load code from locations specified by the environment variables `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `$LD_PRELOAD` and run it with the process's authority. If a setuid program did this, it would be insecure, because its caller could get it to run arbitrary code and hence misuse its authority. For this reason, libc unsets these environment variables at startup in a setuid process. setuid programs usually unset unknown environment variables and check others or set them to reasonable values.

In general, the collection of environment variables function as an associative array where both the keys and values are strings. The interpretation of characters in either string differs among systems. When data structures such as lists need to be represented, it is common to use a colon (common on Unix and Unix-like) or semicolon-delineated (common on Windows and DOS) list.


## Syntax

The variables can be used both in scripts and on the command line. They are usually referenced by putting special symbols in front of or around the variable name.

By convention, names of environment variables are normally expressed in all capital letters. This helps keep environment variables distinctly different from other variables and identifiers used in programming codes. Nevertheless, note that case sensitivity in environment variable names differs between operating systems. That is, Unix-like operating systems are case-sensitive with respect to environment variable names, while DOS, OS/2, and Windows are not case-sensitive.

### Unix

In most Unix and Unix-like command-line shells, an environment variable's value is retrieved by placing a `$` sign before the variable's name. If necessary, the name can also be surrounded by braces.

To display the user home directory, the user may type:

```mw
echo $HOME
```

In Unix and Unix-like systems, the names of environment variables are case-sensitive.

The command **`env`** displays all environment variables and their values. The command **`printenv`** can also be used to print a single variable by giving that variable name as the sole argument to the command.

### DOS, OS/2 and Windows

In DOS, OS/2 and Windows command-line interpreters such as `COMMAND.COM` and `CMD.EXE`, an environment variable is retrieved by placing a `%` sign before and after it.

In DOS, OS/2 and Windows command-line interpreters as well as their API, upper or lower case is not distinguished for environment variable names.

The environment variable named `HOMEDRIVE` contains the drive letter (plus its trailing `:` colon) of the user's home directory, whilst `HOMEPATH` contains the full path of the user's home directory within that drive.

So to see the home drive and path, the user may type this:

```mw
ECHO %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%
```

The command **`SET`** (with no arguments) displays all environment variables and their values. In Windows NT and later `set` can also be used to print all variables whose name begins with a given prefix by giving the prefix as the sole argument to the command.

In Windows PowerShell, the user may type the following:

```mw
"$Env:HomeDrive$Env:HomePath"
```

or one of the following redundant equivalents:

```mw
Write-Output "$Env:HomeDrive$Env:HomePath"
echo "$Env:HomeDrive$Env:HomePath"
write "$Env:HomeDrive$Env:HomePath"
return "$Env:HomeDrive$Env:HomePath"
Write-Host "$Env:HomeDrive$Env:HomePath"
```

In PowerShell, upper or lower case is not distinguished for environment variable names.

The following command displays all environment variables and their values:

```mw
Get-ChildItem env:
```

### Assignment: Unix

The commands `env` and `set` can be used to set environment variables and are often incorporated directly into the shell.

The following commands can also be used, but are often dependent on a certain shell.

```
VARIABLE=value         # (there must be no spaces around the equals sign)
export VARIABLE        # for Bourne and related shells
```

```
export VARIABLE=value  # for ksh, bash, and related shells
```

```
setenv VARIABLE value  # for csh and related shells
```

A few simple principles govern how environment variables achieve their effect.

Environment variables are local to the process in which they were set. If two shell processes are spawned and the value of an environment variable is changed in one, that change will not be seen by the other.

When a child process is created, it inherits all the environment variables and their values from the parent process. Usually, when a program calls another program, it first creates a child process by forking, then the child adjusts the environment as needed and lastly the child replaces itself with the program to be called. This procedure gives the calling program control over the environment of the called program.

In Unix shells, variables may be assigned without the **`export`** keyword. Variables defined in this way are displayed by the **`set`** command, but are *not* true environment variables, as they are stored only by the shell and are unknown to all other processes. The `printenv` command will not display them, and child processes do not inherit them.

```
VARIABLE=value
```

The prefix syntax exports a "true" environment variable to a child process without affecting the current process:

```
VARIABLE=value program_name [arguments]
```

The persistence of an environment variable can be session-wide or system-wide.

**`unset`** is a builtin command implemented by both the Bourne shell family (`sh`, `ksh`, `bash`, etc.) and the C shell family (csh, tcsh, etc.) of Unix command line shells. It unsets a shell variable, removing it from memory and the shell's exported environment. It is implemented as a shell builtin, because it directly manipulates the internals of the shell. Read-only shell variables cannot be unset. If one tries to unset a read-only variable, the `unset` command will print an error message and return a non-zero exit code.

### Assignment: DOS, OS/2 and Windows

In DOS, OS/2 and Windows command-line interpreters such as `COMMAND.COM` and `CMD.EXE`, the **`SET`** command is used to assign environment variables and values using the following arguments:

```mw
 SET VARIABLE=value
```

An environment variable is removed via:

```mw
 SET VARIABLE=
```

The **`SET`** command without any arguments displays all environment variables along with their values; **`SET " "`**, zero or more spaces, will include internal variables too. In `CMD.EXE`, it is possible to assign local variables that will not be global using the **`SETLOCAL`** command and **`ENDLOCAL`** to restore the environment.

Use the switch **`/?`** to display the internal documentation, or use the viewer **`help`**:

```mw
 SET /?
 HELP SET
 SETLOCAL /?
 HELP SETLOCAL
```

In PowerShell, the assignment follows a syntax similar to Unix:

```mw
 $env:VARIABLE = "VALUE"
```

### Assignment: PHP

In PHP the `putenv()` function should be used.

```mw
  putenv("VARIABLE_NAME"="VALUE");
```


## Examples

Examples of environment variables include:

- `PATH`: a list of directory paths. When the user types a command without providing the full path, this list is checked to see whether it contains a path that leads to the command.
- `HOME` (Unix-like) and `USERPROFILE` (Microsoft Windows): indicate where a user's home directory is located in the file system.
- `HOME/{.AppName}` (Unix-like) and `APPDATA\{DeveloperName\AppName}` (Microsoft Windows): for storing application settings. Many applications incorrectly use `USERPROFILE` for application settings in Windows: `USERPROFILE` should only be used in dialogs that allow user to choose between paths like `Documents/Pictures/Downloads/Music`; for programmatic purposes, `APPDATA` (for roaming application settings shared across multiple devices), `LOCALAPPDATA` (for local application settings) or `PROGRAMDATA` (for application settings shared between multiple OS users) should be used.
- `TERM` (Unix-like): specifies the type of computer terminal or terminal emulator being used (e.g., `vt100` or `dumb`).
- `PS1` (Unix-like): specifies how the prompt is displayed in the Bourne shell and variants.
- `MAIL` (Unix-like): used to indicate where a user's mail is to be found.
- `TEMP`: location where processes can store temporary files.


## True environment variables

### Unix

**`$PATH`**

Contains a colon-separated list of directories that the shell searches for commands that do not contain a slash in their name (commands with slashes are interpreted as file names to execute, and the shell attempts to execute the files directly). It is equivalent to the

DOS

,

OS/2

and

Windows

%PATH%

variable.

**`$HOME`**

Contains the location of the user's

home directory

. Although the current user's home directory can also be found out through the C-functions

getpwuid

and

getuid

,

$HOME

is often used for convenience in various shell scripts (and other contexts). Using the environment variable also gives the user the possibility to point to another directory.

**`$PWD`**

This variable points to the current directory. Equivalent to the output of the command pwd when called without arguments.

**`$DISPLAY`**

Contains the identifier for the display that

X11

programs should use by default.

**`$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`**

On many Unix systems with a

dynamic linker

, contains a colon-separated list of directories that the dynamic linker should search for

shared objects

when building a process image after

exec

, before searching in any other directories.

**`$LIBPATH` or `$SHLIB_PATH`**

Alternatives to

$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

typically used on older Unix versions.

**`$LANG, $LC_ALL, $LC_...`**

$LANG

is used to set to the default

locale

. For example, if the locale values are

pt_BR

, then the language is set to (Brazilian) Portuguese and Brazilian practice is used where relevant. Different aspects of localization are controlled by individual

$LC_

-variables (

$LC_CTYPE

,

$LC_

COLLATE

,

$LC_DATE

etc.).

$LC_ALL

can be used to force the same locale for all aspects.

**`$TZ`**

Refers to

time zone

. It can be in several formats, either specifying the time zone itself or referencing a file (in

/usr/share/zoneinfo

).

**`$BROWSER`**

Contains a colon-separated list of a user's

web browser

preferences, for use by programs that need to allow the user to view content at a

URL

. The browsers in the list are intended to be attempted from first to last, stopping after the first one that succeeds. This arrangement allows for fallback behavior in different environments, e.g., in an

X11

environment, a graphical browser (such as

Firefox

) can be used, but in a console environment a terminal-base browser (such as

Lynx

) can be used. A

%s

token may be present to specify where the URL should be placed; otherwise the browser should be launched with the URL as the first argument.

### DOS

Under DOS, the *master environment* is provided by the primary command processor, which inherits the *pre-environment* defined in `CONFIG.SYS` when first loaded. Its size can be configured through the `COMMAND /E:n` parameter between 160 and 32767 bytes. *Local environment* segments inherited to child processes are typically reduced down to the size of the contents they hold. Some command-line processors (like 4DOS) allow to define a minimum amount of free environment space that will be available when launching secondary shells. While the content of environment variables remains unchanged upon storage, their names (without the "`%`") are always converted to uppercase, with the exception of *pre-environment variables* defined via the `CONFIG.SYS` directive `SET` under DR DOS 6.0 and higher (and only with `SWITCHES=/L` (for "allow lowercase names") under DR-DOS 7.02 and higher). In principle, MS-DOS 7.0 and higher also supports lowercase variable names (`%windir%`), but provides no means for the user to define them. Environment variable names containing lowercase letters are stored in the environment just like normal environment variables, but remain invisible to most DOS software, since they are written to expect uppercase variables only. Some command processors limit the maximum length of a variable name to 80 characters. While principally only limited by the size of the *environment segment*, some DOS and 16-bit Windows programs do not expect the contents of environment variables to exceed 128 characters. DR-DOS `COMMAND.COM` supports environment variables up to 255, 4DOS even up to 512 characters. Since `COMMAND.COM` can be configured (via `/L:128..1024`) to support command lines up to 1024 characters internally under MS-DOS 7.0 and higher, environment variables should be expected to contain at least 1024 characters as well. In some versions of DR-DOS, the environment passed to drivers, which often do not need their environment after installation, can be shrunken or relocated through `SETENV` or `INSTALL[HIGH]`/`LOADHIGH` options `/Z` (zero environment), `/D[:loaddrive]` (substitute drive, e.g. `B:TSR.COM`) and `/E` (relocate environment above program) in order to minimize the driver's effectively resulting resident memory footprint.

In batch mode, non-existent environment variables are replaced by a zero-length string.

*Standard environment variables* or *reserved environment variables* include:

**`%APPEND%` (supported since DOS 3.3)**

This variable contains a semicolon-delimited list of directories in which to search for files. It is usually changed via the

APPEND

/E

command, which also ensures that the directory names are converted into uppercase. Some DOS software actually expects the names to be stored in uppercase and the length of the list not to exceed 121

characters, therefore the variable is best not modified via the

SET

command.

Long filenames

containing spaces or other special characters must not be quoted (

"

).

**`%CONFIG%` (supported since MS-DOS 6.0 and PC DOS 6.1, also supported by ROM-DOS)**

This variable holds the symbolic name of the currently chosen boot configuration. It is set by the

DOS BIOS

(

IO.SYS

,

IBMBIO.COM

, etc.) to the name defined by the corresponding

CONFIG.SYS

directive

MENUITEM

before launching the primary command processor. Its main purpose is to allow further special cases in

AUTOEXEC.BAT

and similar batchjobs depending on the selected option at boot time. This can be emulated under DR-DOS by utilizing the

CONFIG.SYS

directive

SET

like

SET CONFIG=1

.

**`%CMDLINE%` (introduced with 4DOS, also supported since MS-DOS 7.0)**

This variable contains the fully expanded text of the currently executing command line. It can be read by applications to detect the usage of and retrieve long command lines, since the traditional method to retrieve the command line arguments through the

PSP

(or related

API

functions) is limited to 126 characters and is no longer available when

FCBs

get expanded or the default

DTA

is used. While 4DOS supports longer command lines,

COMMAND.COM

still only supports a maximum of 126 characters at the prompt by default (unless overridden with

/U:128..255

to specify the size of the command line buffer), but nevertheless internal command lines can become longer through f.e. variable expansion (depending on

/L:128..1024

to specify the size of the internal buffer). In addition to the command-line length byte in the PSP, the PSP command line is normally limited by

ASCII-13

, and command lines longer than 126 characters will typically be truncated by having an ASCII-13 inserted at position 127,

but this cannot be relied upon in all scenarios.

The variable will be suppressed for external commands invoked with a preceding

@

-symbol like in

@XCOPY ...

for backward compatibility and in order to minimize the size of the environment when loading non-relocating

terminate-and-stay-resident programs

. Some beta versions of

Windows Chicago

used

%CMDLINE%

to store only the remainder of the command line excessing 126 characters instead of the complete command line.

**`%COMSPEC%` (supported since DOS 2.0)**

This variable contains the full

8.3

path to the

command processor

, typically

C:\

COMMAND.COM

or

C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM

. It must not contain

long filenames

, but under DR-DOS it may contain

file

and

directory passwords

. It is set up by the primary command processor to point to itself (typically reflecting the settings of the

CONFIG.SYS

directive

SHELL

), so that the resident portion of the command processor can reload its transient portion from disk after the execution of larger programs. The value can be changed at runtime to reflect changes in the configuration, which would require the command processor to reload itself from other locations. The variable is also used when launching secondary shells.

**`%COPYCMD%` (supported since MS-DOS 6.2 and PC DOS 6.3, also supported by ROM-DOS)**

Allows a user to specify the

/Y

switch (to assume "Yes" on queries) as the default for the

COPY

,

XCOPY

, and

MOVE

commands. A default of

/Y

can be overridden by supplying the

/-Y

switch on the command line. The

/Y

switch instructs the command to replace existing files without prompting for confirmation.

**`%DIRCMD%` (supported since MS-DOS 5.0 and PC DOS 5.0, also supported by ROM-DOS)**

Allows a user to specify customized default parameters for the

DIR

command, including file specifications. Preset default switches can be overridden by providing the negative switch on the command line. For example, if

%DIRCMD%

contains the

/W

switch, then it can be overridden by using

DIR /-W

at the command line. This is similar to the environment variable

%$DIR%

under

DOS Plus

and a facility to define default switches for

DIR

through its

/C

or

/R

switches under

DR-DOS

COMMAND.COM

.

%DIRCMD%

is also supported by the external

SDIR.COM

/

DIR.COM

Stacker

commands under

Novell DOS 7

and higher.

**`%LANG%` (supported since MS-DOS 7.0)**

This variable is supported by some tools to switch the locale for messages in multilingual issues.

**`%LANGSPEC%` (supported since MS-DOS 7.0)**

This variable is supported by some tools to switch the locale for messages in multilingual issues.

**`%NO_SEP%` (supported since PC DOS 6.3 and DR-DOS 7.07)**

This variable controls the display of

thousands-separators

in messages of various commands. Issued by default, they can be suppressed by specifying

SET NO_SEP=ON

or

SET NO_SEP=1

under PC DOS. DR-DOS additionally allows to override the system's thousands-separator displayed as in f.e.

SET NO_SEP=.

.

**`%PATH%` (supported since DOS 2.0)**

This variable contains a semicolon-delimited list of directories in which the

command interpreter

will search for

executable files

. Equivalent to the Unix

$PATH

variable (but some DOS and Windows applications also use the list to search for data files similar to

$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

on Unix-like systems). It is usually changed via the

PATH

(or

PATH /E

under

MS-DOS 6.0

) command, which also ensures that the directory names are converted into uppercase. Some DOS software actually expects the names to be stored in uppercase and the length of the list not to exceed 123

characters,

therefore the variable should better not be modified via the

SET

command.

Long filenames

containing spaces or other special characters must not be quoted (

"

). By default, the current directory is searched first, but some command-line processors like

4DOS

allow "

.

" (for "current directory") to be included in the list as well in order to override this search order; some DOS programs are incompatible with this extension.

**`%PROMPT%` (supported since DOS 2.0)**

This variable contains a

$

-tokenized string defining the display of the

prompt

. It is usually changed via the

PROMPT

command.

**`%TEMP%` (and `%TMP%`)**

These variables contain the path to the directory where

temporary files

should be stored. Operating system tools typically only use

%TEMP%

, whereas third-party programs also use

%TMP%

. Typically

%TEMP%

takes precedence over

%TMP%

.

The DR-DOS family supports a number of additional *standard environment variables* including:

**`%BETA%`**

This variable contains an optional message displayed by some versions (including

DR DOS 3.41

) of

COMMAND.COM

at the startup of secondary shells.

**`%DRDOSCFG%`/`%NWDOSCFG%`/`%OPENDOSCFG%`**

This variable contains the directory

(without trailing "

\

") where to search for

.INI

and

.CFG

configuration files (that is, DR-DOS application specific files like

TASKMGR.INI

,

TASKMAX.INI

,

VIEWMAX.INI

,

FASTBACK.CFG

etc., class specific files like

COLORS.INI

, or global files like

DRDOS.INI

,

NWDOS.INI

,

OPENDOS.INI

, or

DOS.INI

), as used by the

INSTALL

and

SETUP

commands and various DR-DOS programs like

DISKOPT

,

DOSBOOK

,

EDIT

,

FBX

,

FILELINK

,

LOCK

,

SECURITY.OVL

/

NWLOGIN.EXE

,

SERNO

,

TASKMAX

,

TASKMGR

,

VIEWMAX

, or

UNDELETE

.

It must not contain

long filenames

.

**`%DRCOMSPEC%`**

This variable optionally holds an alternative path to the command processor taking precedence over the path defined in the

%COMSPEC%

variable, optionally including

file

and

directory passwords

. Alternatively, it can hold a special value of "

ON

" or "

1

" in order to enforce the usage of the

%COMSPEC%

variable even in scenarios where the

%COMSPEC%

variable may point to the wrong command-line processor, for example, when running some versions of the DR-DOS

SYS

command under a foreign operating system.

**`%DRSYS%`**

Setting this variable to "

ON

" or "

1

" will force some versions of the DR-DOS

SYS

command to work under foreign operating systems instead of displaying a warning.

**`%FBP_USER%`**

Specifies the user name used by the

FastBack

command

FBX

and

{user}

.FB

configuration files under

Novell DOS 7

.

**`%HOMEDIR%`**

This variable may contain the home directory under DR-DOS (including

DR DOS 5.0

and

6.0

).

**`%INFO%`**

In some versions of DR-DOS

COMMAND.COM

this variable defines the string displayed by the

$I

token of the

PROMPT

command.

It can be used, for example, to inform the user how to exit secondary shells.

**`%LOGINNAME%`**

In some versions of DR-DOS

COMMAND.COM

this variable defines the user name displayed by the

$U

token of the

PROMPT

command, as set up by f.e. login scripts for

Novell NetWare

.

See also the similarly named pseudo-variable

%LOGIN_NAME%

.

**`%MDOS_EXEC%`**

This variable can take the values "

ON

" or "

OFF

" under

Multiuser DOS

. If enabled, the operating system permits applications to shell out to secondary shells with the

DOS Program Area

(DPA) freed in order to have maximum DOS memory available for secondary applications instead of running them in the same domain as under DOS.

**`%NOCHAR%`**

This variable can be used to define the character displayed by some commands in messages for "No" in

[Y,N]

queries, thereby overriding the current system default (typically "

N

" in English versions of DR-DOS). If it contains a string, only the first character, uppercased, will be taken. Some commands also support a command line parameter

/Y

to automatically assume "Yes" on queries, thereby suppressing such prompts. If, however, the parameter

/Y:yn

is used to specify the "Yes"/"No" characters (thereby overriding any

%NOCHAR%

setting), queries are not suppressed. See also the related

CONFIG.SYS

directive

NOCHAR

and the environment variable

%YESCHAR%

.

**`%NOSOUND%`**

Setting this variable to "

ON

" or "

1

" will disable default beeps issued by some DR-DOS commands in certain situations such as to inform the user of the completion of some operation, that user interaction is required, or when a wrong key was pressed. Command line options to specifically enable certain beeps will override this setting.

**`%OS%`**

This variable contains the name of the operating system in order to distinguish between different DOS-related operating systems of

Digital Research

-origin in batch jobs and applications.

**`%PEXEC%`**

In some versions of DR-DOS this variable defines the command executed by the

$X

token of the

PROMPT

command before

COMMAND.COM

displays the prompt after returning from external program execution.

**`%SWITCHAR%`**

This variable defines the

SwitChar

to be used for argument parsing by some DR-DOS commands. If defined, it overrides the system's current SwitChar setting. The only accepted characters are "

/

" (DOS style), "

-

" (Unix style) and "

[

" (CP/M style). See also the related

**`%YESCHAR%`**

This variable can be used to define the character displayed by some commands in messages for "Yes" in

[Y,N]

queries, thereby overriding the current system default (typically "

Y

" in English versions of DR-DOS). If it contains a string, only the first character, uppercased, will be taken. Some commands also support a command line parameter

/Y

to automatically assume "Yes" on queries, thereby suppressing such prompts. If, however, the parameter

/Y:y

is used to specify the "Yes" character (thereby overriding any

%YESCHAR%

setting), queries are not suppressed. See also the related

CONFIG.SYS

directive

YESCHAR

and the environment variable

%NOCHAR%

.

**`%$CLS%`**

This variable defines the control sequence to be sent to the console driver to clear the screen when the

CLS

command is issued, thereby overriding the internal default ("

←[2J

" under DR-DOS, "

←E

" under

DOS Plus 1.2

on Amstrad machines

as well as under

Concurrent DOS

,

Multiuser DOS

, and

REAL/32

for

VT52

terminals, or "

←+

" under Multiuser DOS for

ASCII

terminals).

If the variable is not defined and no

ANSI.SYS

console driver is detected, the DR-DOS

COMMAND.COM

will directly clear the screen via

INT 10h/AH=00h

BIOS

function, like MS-DOS/PC DOS

COMMAND.COM

does. A special

\nnn

-notation for

octal numbers

is supported to allow the definition of special characters like ESC (

ASCII-27

= "←" = 1Bh = 33o), as f.e. in

SET $CLS=\033[2J

. To send the backslash ("

\

") itself, it can be doubled "

\\

".

**`%$DIR%`**

Supported by

DOS Plus

accepting the values "L" (long) or "W" (wide) to change the default layout of directory listings with

DIR

. Can be overridden using the command line options

/L

or

/W

.

See also the similar environment variable

%DIRCMD%

and the

DIR

options

/C

and

/R

of the DR-DOS COMMAND.COM.

**`%$PAGE%`**

Supported by

DOS Plus

accepting the values "

ON

" or "

OFF

" for pagination control. Setting this to "

ON

" has the same affect as adding

/P

to commands supporting it (like

DIR

or

TYPE

).

**`%$LENGTH%`**

Used by

DOS Plus

to define the screen length of the console in lines. This is used to control in a portable way when the screen output should be temporarily halted until a key is pressed in conjunction with the

/P

option supported by various commands or with automatic pagnination.

See also the related environment variables

%$WIDTH%

and

%DIRSIZE%

as well as the similar pseudo-variable

%_ROWS%

.

**`%$WIDTH%`**

Used by

DOS Plus

to define the screen width of the console in columns. This is used to control in a portable way the formatting of the screen output of commands like

DIR

/W

or

TYPE

filename

.

See also the related environment variables

%$LENGTH%

and

%DIRSIZE%

as well as the similar pseudo-variable

%_COLUMNS%

.

**`%$SLICE%`**

Used by

DOS Plus

accepting a numerical value to control the foreground/background time slicing of multitasking programs.

See also the DOS Plus command

SLICE

.

**`%$ON%`**

This variable can hold an optional control sequence to switch text highlighting, reversion or colorization on. It is used to emphasize or otherwise control the display of the file names in commands like

TYPE

wildcard

, for example

SET $ON=\033[1m

with

ANSI.SYS

loaded or

SET $ON=\016

for an IBM or

ESC/P

printer. For the special

\nnn

octal notation supported, see

%$CLS%

.

While the variable is undefined by default under DOS Plus and DR-DOS, the

Multiuser DOS

default for an

ASCII

terminal equals

SET $ON=\033p

.

See also the related environment variable

%$OFF%

.

**`%$OFF%`**

This variable can hold an optional control sequence to switch text highlighting, reversion or colorization off. It is used to return to the normal output after the display of file names in commands like

TYPE

wildcard

, for example

SET $OFF=\033[0m

with

ANSI.SYS

loaded or

SET $OFF=\024

for an IBM or

ESC/P

printer. For the special

\nnn

octal notation supported, see

%$CLS%

.

While the variable is undefined by default under DOS Plus and DR-DOS, the

Multiuser DOS

default for an

ASCII

terminal equals

SET $OFF=\033q

.

See also the related environment variable

%$ON%

.

**`%$HEADER%`**

This variable can hold an optional control sequence issued before the output of the file contents in commands like

TYPE

under DR-DOS 7.02 and higher. It can be used for highlighting, pagination or formatting, f.e. when sending the output to a printer, i.e.

SET $HEADER=\017

for an IBM or

ESC/P

printer. For the special

\nnn

octal notation supported, see

%$CLS%

.

See also the related environment variable

%$FOOTER%

.

**`%$FOOTER%`**

This variable can hold an optional control sequence issued after the output of the file contents in commands like

TYPE

under DR-DOS 7.02 and higher. It is used to return to the normal output format, i.e.

SET $FOOTER=\022\014

in the printer example above. For the special

\nnn

octal notation supported, see

%$CLS%

.

See also the related environment variable

%$HEADER%

.

Datalight ROM-DOS supports a number of additional *standard environment variables* as well including:

**`%DIRSIZE%`**

This variable is used to define non-standard screen sizes

rows[,cols]

for

DIR

options

/P

and

/W

(similar to

%$LENGTH%

and

%$WIDTH%

under DOS Plus).

**`%NEWFILE%`**

This variable is automatically set to the first parameter given to the CONFIG.SYS directive

NEWFILE

.

`%TZ%`, `%COMM%`, `%SOCKETS%`, `%HTTP_DIR%`, `%HOSTNAME%` and `%FTPDIR%` are also used by ROM-DOS.

### OS/2

**`%BEGINLIBPATH%`**

Contains a semicolon-separated list of directories which are searched for

DLLs

before

the directories given by the

%LIBPATH%

variable (which is set during system startup with the special

CONFIG.SYS

directive

LIBPATH

). It is possible to specify relative directories here, including "

.

" for the current working directory. See also the related environment variable

%ENDLIBPATH%

.

**`%ENDLIBPATH%`**

a list of directories to be searched for

DLLs

like

%BEGINLIBPATH%

, but searched

after

the list of directories in

%LIBPATH%

.

### Windows

These environment variables refer to locations of critical operating system resources, and as such generally are not user-dependent.

**`%APPDATA%`**

Contains the full path to the

Application Data

directory of the logged-in user. Does not work on Windows NT 4.0 SP6 UK.

**`%LOCALAPPDATA%`**

This variable is the local data files of

Applications

. Its uses include storing of

desktop themes

,

Windows error reporting

, caching and profiles of web browsers.

**`%ComSpec%`/`%COMSPEC%`**

The

%ComSpec%

variable contains the full path to the command processor; on the Windows NT family of operating systems, this is

cmd.exe

, while on

Windows 9x

,

%COMSPEC%

is

COMMAND.COM

.

**`%OS%`**

The

%OS%

variable contains a symbolic name of the operating system family to distinguish between differing feature sets in

batchjobs

. It resembles an identically named environment variable

%OS%

found in all DOS-related operating systems of

Digital Research

-origin like Concurrent DOS,

Multiuser DOS

, REAL/32,

DOS Plus

,

DR DOS

, Novell DOS and OpenDOS.

%OS%

always holds the string "

Windows_NT

" on the

Windows NT family

.

**`%PATH%`**

This variable contains a semicolon-delimited (do not put spaces in between) list of directories in which the command interpreter will search for an executable file that matches the given command. Environment variables that represent paths may be nested within the

%PATH%

variable, but only at one level of indirection. If this sub-path environment variable itself contains an environment variable representing a path,

%PATH%

will not expand properly in the variable substitution. Equivalent to the

Unix

$PATH

variable.

**`%PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE%`, `%PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432%`, `%PROCESSOR_IDENTIFIER%`, `%PROCESSOR_LEVEL%`, `%PROCESSOR_REVISION%`**

These variables contain details of the

CPU

; they are set during system installation.

**`%PUBLIC%`**

The

%PUBLIC%

variable (introduced with Vista) points to the

Public

(pseudo) user profile directory "

C:\Users\Public

".

**`%ProgramFiles%`, `%ProgramFiles(x86)%`, `%ProgramW6432%`**

The

%ProgramFiles%

variable points to the

Program Files

directory, which stores all the installed programs of Windows and others. The default on English-language systems is "

C:\Program Files

". In 64-bit editions of Windows (XP, 2003, Vista), there are also

%ProgramFiles(x86)%

, which defaults to "

C:\Program Files (x86)

", and

%ProgramW6432%

, which defaults to "

C:\Program Files

". The

%ProgramFiles%

itself depends on whether the process requesting the environment variable is itself 32-bit or 64-bit (this is caused by

Windows-on-Windows 64-bit

redirection

).

**`%CommonProgramFiles%`, `%CommonProgramFiles(x86)%`, `%CommonProgramW6432%`**

This variable points to the

Common Files

subdirectory of the

Program Files

directory. The default on English-language systems is "

C:\Program Files\Common Files

". In 64-bit editions of Windows (XP, 2003, Vista), there are also

%ProgramFiles(x86)%

, which defaults to "

C:\Program Files (x86)

", and

%ProgramW6432%

, which defaults to "

C:\Program Files

". The

%ProgramFiles%

itself depends on whether the process requesting the environment variable is itself 32-bit or 64-bit (this is caused by

Windows-on-Windows 64-bit

redirection).

**`%OneDrive%`**

The

%OneDrive%

variable is a special system-wide environment variable found on Windows NT and its derivatives. Its value is the path of where (if installed and setup) the Onedrive directory is located. The value of

%OneDrive%

is in most cases "

C:\Users\{Username}\OneDrive\

".

**`%SystemDrive%`**

The

%SystemDrive%

variable is a special system-wide environment variable found on Windows NT and its derivatives. Its value is the drive upon which the system directory was placed. The value of

%SystemDrive%

is in most cases "

C:

".

**`%SystemRoot%`**

The

%SystemRoot%

variable is a special system-wide environment variable found on the Windows NT family of operating systems. Its value is the location of the system directory, including the drive and path. The drive is the same as

%SystemDrive%

and the default path on a clean installation depends upon the version of the operating system. By default:

- Windows XP and newer versions use "`\WINDOWS`".
- Windows 2000, NT 4.0 and NT 3.1 use "`\WINNT`".
- Windows NT 3.5 and NT 3.51 uses "`\WINNT35`".
- Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server uses "`\WTSRV`".

**`%windir%`**

This variable points to the

Windows

directory. (On the Windows NT family of operating systems, it is identical to the

%SystemRoot%

variable).

Windows 95

–

98

and

Windows ME

are, by default, installed in "

C:\Windows

". For other versions of Windows, see the

%SystemRoot%

entry above.

*User management variables* store information related to resources and settings owned by various user profiles within the system. As a general rule, these variables do not refer to critical system resources or locations that are necessary for the OS to run.

**`%ALLUSERSPROFILE%` (`%PROGRAMDATA%` since Windows Vista)**

This variable expands to the full path to the

All Users

profile directory. This profile contains resources and settings that are used by all system accounts.

Shortcut

links copied to the

All Users

\'

Start menu

or

Desktop

directories will appear in every user's

Start menu

or

Desktop

, respectively.

**`%USERDOMAIN%`**

The name of the

Workgroup

or

Windows Domain

to which the current user belongs. The related variable,

%LOGONSERVER%

, holds the

hostname

of the server that authenticated the current user's login credentials (name and password). For home PCs and PCs in a workgroup, the authenticating server is usually the PC itself. For PCs in a Windows domain, the authenticating server is a

domain controller

(a primary domain controller, or PDC, in Windows NT 4-based domains).

**`%USERPROFILE%`**

A special system-wide environment variable found on Windows NT and its derivatives. Its value is the location of the current user's profile directory, in which is found that user's HKCU registry hive (

NTUSER

). Users can also use the

%USERNAME%

variable to determine the active users login identification.

*Optional System variables* are not explicitly specified by default but can be used to modify the default behavior of certain built-in console commands. These variables also do not need to be explicitly specified as command line arguments.

#### Default values

The following tables shows typical default values of certain environment variables under English versions of Windows as they can be retrieved under `CMD`.

(Some of these variables are also defined when running `COMMAND.COM` under Windows, but differ in certain important details: Under `COMMAND.COM`, the names of environment variable are always uppercased. Some, but not all variables contain short 8.3 rather than long file names. While some variables present in the `CMD` environment are missing, there are also some variables specific to the `COMMAND` environment.)
