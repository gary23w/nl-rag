- See full compatibility

The **`<head>`** HTML element contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document, like its title, scripts, and style sheets. There can be only one `<head>` element in an HTML document.

**Note:** `<head>` primarily holds information for machine processing, not human-readability. For human-visible information, like top-level headings and listed authors, see the `<header>` element.

## Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

**`profile`**

The URIs of one or more metadata profiles, separated by white space.

## Examples

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>Document title</title>
  </head>
</html>
```
