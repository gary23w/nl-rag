# GNU Octave

GNU Octave

## (GNU Octave logo) GNU Octave

**Scientific Programming Language**

- Powerful mathematics-oriented syntax with built-in 2D/3D plotting and visualization tools
- Free software, runs on GNU/Linux, macOS, BSD, and Microsoft Windows
- Drop-in compatible with many Matlab scripts

### Syntax Examples

The Octave syntax is largely compatible with Matlab. The Octave interpreter can be run in GUI mode, as a console, or invoked as part of a shell script. More Octave examples can be found in the Octave wiki.

Solve systems of equations with linear algebra operations on **vectors** and **matrices**.

```octave
b = [4; 9; 2] # Column vector
A = [ 3 4 5;
      1 3 1;
      3 5 9 ]
x = A \ b     # Solve the system Ax = b
```

Visualize data with **high-level plot commands** in 2D and 3D.

```octave
x = -10:0.1:10; # Create an evenly-spaced vector from -10..10
y = sin (x);    # y is also a vector
plot (x, y);
title ("Simple 2-D Plot");
xlabel ("x");
ylabel ("sin (x)");
```
