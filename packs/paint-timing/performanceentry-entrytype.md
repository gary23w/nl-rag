# PerformanceEntry: entryType property

Baseline

Widely available

This feature is well established and works across many devices and browser versions. It’s been available across browsers since September 2017.

- See full compatibility

**Note:** This feature is available in Web Workers.

The read-only **`entryType`** property returns a string representing the type of performance metric that this entry represents.

All supported `entryTypes` are available using the static property `PerformanceObserver.supportedEntryTypes`.

## Value

A string. The return value depends on the subtype of the `PerformanceEntry` object. Some subtypes have more than one `entryType`.

**`element`**

Reports load time of elements.

The entry instance will be a `PerformanceElementTiming` object.

**`event`**

Reports event latencies.

The entry instance will be a `PerformanceEventTiming` object.

**`first-input`**

Reports the First Input Delay (FID).

The entry instance will be a `PerformanceEventTiming` object.

**`largest-contentful-paint`**

Reports the largest paint an element triggered on screen.

The entry instance will be a `LargestContentfulPaint` object.

**`layout-shift`**

Reports layout stability of web pages based on movements of the elements on the page.

The entry instance will be a `LayoutShift` object.

**`long-animation-frame`**

Reports instances of long animation frames (LoAFs).

The entry instance will be a `PerformanceLongAnimationFrameTiming` object.

**`longtask`**

Reports instances of long tasks.

The entry instance will be a `PerformanceLongTaskTiming` object.

**`mark`**

Reports your own custom performance markers.

The entry instance will be a `PerformanceMark` object.

**`measure`**

Reports your own custom performance measures.

The entry instance will be a `PerformanceMeasure` object.

**`navigation`**

Reports document navigation timing.

The entry instance will be a `PerformanceNavigationTiming` object.

**`paint`**

Reports key moments of document rendering (first paint, first contentful paint) during page load.

The entry instance will be a `PerformancePaintTiming` object.

**`resource`**

Reports timing information for resources in a document.

The entry instance will be a `PerformanceResourceTiming` object.

**`taskattribution`**

Reports the type of work that contributed significantly to the long task.

The entry instance will be a `TaskAttributionTiming` object.

**`visibility-state`**

Reports the timing of page visibility state changes, i.e., when a tab changes from the foreground to the background or vice versa.

The entry instance will be a `VisibilityStateEntry` object.

## Examples

### Filtering performance entries by type

The `entryType` property can be useful when filtering out specific performance entries. For example, you might want to check all script resources, so you would check for an `entryType` of `"resource"` and an `initiatorType` of `"script"`.

```js
const scriptResources = performance
  .getEntries()
  .filter(
    (entry) =>
      entry.entryType === "resource" && entry.initiatorType === "script",
  );
console.log(scriptResources);
```

### Getting performance entries by type

Both, `Performance` and `PerformanceObserver`, provide methods that allow you to get performance entries by type directly. You don't necessarily need the `entryType` property for that, instead you might use `Performance.getEntriesByType()` or `PerformanceObserverEntryList.getEntriesByType()`.

Also, when observing with a `PerformanceObserver`, the `observe()` method takes an array of `entryTypes` in its options object where you can decide which entry types to observe.

```js
// Log all resource entries at this point
const resources = performance.getEntriesByType("resource");
resources.forEach((entry) => {
  console.log(`${entry.name}'s duration: ${entry.duration}`);
});

// PerformanceObserver version
// Log all resource entries when they are available
function perfObserver(list, observer) {
  list.getEntriesByType("resource").forEach((entry) => {
    console.log(`${entry.name}'s duration: ${entry.duration}`);
  });
}
const observer = new PerformanceObserver(perfObserver);
observer.observe({ entryTypes: ["resource", "navigation"] });
```
