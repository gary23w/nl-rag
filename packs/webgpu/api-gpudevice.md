# GPUDevice

Limited availability

This feature is not Baseline because it does not work in some of the most widely-used browsers.

**Secure context:** This feature is available only in secure contexts (HTTPS), in some or all supporting browsers.

**Note:** This feature is available in Web Workers.

The **`GPUDevice`** interface of the WebGPU API represents a logical GPU device. This is the main interface through which the majority of WebGPU functionality is accessed.

A `GPUDevice` object is requested using the `GPUAdapter.requestDevice()` method.

## Instance properties

*Inherits properties from its parent, `EventTarget`.*

**`adapterInfo` Read only**

A `GPUAdapterInfo` object containing identifying information about the device's originating adapter.

**`features` Read only**

A `GPUSupportedFeatures` object that describes additional functionality supported by the device.

**`label`**

A string providing a label that can be used to identify the object, for example in `GPUError` messages or console warnings.

**`limits` Read only**

A `GPUSupportedLimits` object that describes the limits supported by the device.

**`lost` Read only**

Contains a `Promise` that remains pending throughout the device's lifetime and resolves with a `GPUDeviceLostInfo` object when the device is lost.

**`queue` Read only**

Returns the primary `GPUQueue` for the device.

## Instance methods

*Inherits methods from its parent, `EventTarget`.*

**`createBindGroup()`**

Creates a `GPUBindGroup` based on a `GPUBindGroupLayout` that defines a set of resources to be bound together in a group and how those resources are used in shader stages.

**`createBindGroupLayout()`**

Creates a `GPUBindGroupLayout` that defines the structure and purpose of related GPU resources such as buffers that will be used in a pipeline, and is used as a template when creating `GPUBindGroup`s.

**`createBuffer()`**

Creates a `GPUBuffer` in which to store raw data to use in GPU operations.

**`createCommandEncoder()`**

Creates a `GPUCommandEncoder`, which is used to encode commands to be issued to the GPU.

**`createComputePipeline()`**

Creates a `GPUComputePipeline` that can control the compute shader stage and be used in a `GPUComputePassEncoder`.

**`createComputePipelineAsync()`**

Returns a `Promise` that fulfills with a `GPUComputePipeline`, which can control the compute shader stage and be used in a `GPUComputePassEncoder`, once the pipeline can be used without any stalling.

**`createPipelineLayout()`**

Creates a `GPUPipelineLayout` that defines the `GPUBindGroupLayout`s used by a pipeline. `GPUBindGroup`s used with the pipeline during command encoding must have compatible `GPUBindGroupLayout`s.

**`createQuerySet()`**

Creates a `GPUQuerySet` that can be used to record the results of queries on passes, such as occlusion or timestamp queries.

**`createRenderBundleEncoder()`**

Creates a `GPURenderBundleEncoder` that can be used to pre-record bundles of commands. These can be reused in `GPURenderPassEncoder`s via the `executeBundles()` method, as many times as required.

**`createRenderPipeline()`**

Creates a `GPURenderPipeline` that can control the vertex and fragment shader stages and be used in a `GPURenderPassEncoder` or `GPURenderBundleEncoder`.

**`createRenderPipelineAsync()`**

Returns a `Promise` that fulfills with a `GPURenderPipeline`, which can control the vertex and fragment shader stages and be used in a `GPURenderPassEncoder` or `GPURenderBundleEncoder`, once the pipeline can be used without any stalling.

**`createSampler()`**

Creates a `GPUSampler`, which controls how shaders transform and filter texture resource data.

**`createShaderModule()`**

Creates a `GPUShaderModule` from a string of WGSL source code.

**`createTexture()`**

Creates a `GPUTexture` in which to store texture data to use in GPU rendering operations.

**`destroy()`**

Destroys the device, preventing further operations on it.

**`importExternalTexture()`**

Takes an `HTMLVideoElement` as an input and returns a `GPUExternalTexture` wrapper object containing a snapshot of the video that can be used in GPU rendering operations.

**`popErrorScope()`**

Pops an existing GPU error scope from the error scope stack and returns a `Promise` that resolves to an object (`GPUInternalError`, `GPUOutOfMemoryError`, or `GPUValidationError`) describing the first error captured in the scope, or `null` if no error occurred.

**`pushErrorScope()`**

Pushes a new GPU error scope onto the device's error scope stack, allowing you to capture errors of a particular type.

## Events

**`uncapturederror`**

Fired when an error is thrown that has not been observed by a GPU error scope, to provide a way to report unexpected errors. Known error cases should be handled using `pushErrorScope()` and `popErrorScope()`.

## Examples

```js
async function init() {
  if (!navigator.gpu) {
    throw Error("WebGPU not supported.");
  }

  const adapter = await navigator.gpu.requestAdapter();
  if (!adapter) {
    throw Error("Couldn't request WebGPU adapter.");
  }

  const device = await adapter.requestDevice();

  const shaderModule = device.createShaderModule({
    code: shaders,
  });

  // …
}
```
