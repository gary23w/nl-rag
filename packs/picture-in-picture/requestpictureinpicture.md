The **`HTMLVideoElement`** method **`requestPictureInPicture()`** issues an asynchronous request to display the video in picture-in-picture mode.

It's not guaranteed that the video will be put into picture-in-picture. If permission to enter that mode is granted, the returned `Promise` will resolve and the video will receive an `enterpictureinpicture` event to let it know that it's now in picture-in-picture.

## Syntax

```js
requestPictureInPicture()
```

### Parameters

None.

### Return value

A `Promise` that will resolve to a `PictureInPictureWindow` object that can be used to listen when a user will resize that floating window.

### Exceptions

**`NotSupportedError` `DOMException`**

Thrown if the feature is not supported (for example, disabled by a user preference or by a platform limitation).

**`SecurityError` `DOMException`**

Thrown if the feature is blocked by a Permissions Policy.

**`InvalidStateError` `DOMException`**

Thrown if the video element's `readState` is `HAVE_NOTHING`, or if the video element has no video track, or if the video element's `disablePictureInPicture` attribute is `true`.

**`NotAllowedError` `DOMException`**

Thrown if `document.pictureInPictureElement` is `null` and the document does not have transient activation.

## Security

Transient user activation is required. The user has to interact with the page or a UI element for this feature to work.

## Examples

This example requests that the video enters Picture-in-Picture mode, and sets an event listener to handle the floating window resizing.

```js
function enterPictureInPicture() {
  videoElement.requestPictureInPicture().then((pictureInPictureWindow) => {
    pictureInPictureWindow.addEventListener("resize", () =>
      onPipWindowResize(),
    );
  });
}
```
