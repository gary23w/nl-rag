# Tutorial

Welcome to the Trio tutorial! Trio is a modern Python library for writing asynchronous applications – that is, programs that want to do multiple things at the same time with parallelized I/O, like a web spider that fetches lots of pages in parallel, a web server juggling lots of simultaneous downloads… that sort of thing. Here we’ll try to give a gentle introduction to asynchronous programming with Trio.

We assume that you’re familiar with Python in general, but don’t worry – we don’t assume you know anything about asynchronous programming or Python’s new `async/await` feature.

Also, unlike many `async/await` tutorials, we assume that your goal is to *use* Trio to write interesting programs, so we won’t go into the nitty-gritty details of how `async/await` is implemented inside the Python interpreter. The word “coroutine” is never mentioned. The fact is, you really don’t *need* to know any of that stuff unless you want to *implement* a library like Trio, so we leave it out (though we’ll throw in a few links for those who want to dig deeper).

Okay, ready? Let’s get started.


## Before you begin

1. Make sure you’re using Python 3.10 or newer.
2. `python3 -m pip install --upgrade trio` (or on Windows, maybe `py -3 -m pip install --upgrade trio` – details)
3. Can you `import trio`? If so then you’re good to go!


## If you get lost or confused…

…then we want to know! We have a friendly chat channel, you can ask questions using the “python-trio” tag on StackOverflow, or just file a bug (if our documentation is confusing, that’s our fault, and we want to fix it!).


## Async functions

Python 3.5 added a major new feature: async functions. Using Trio is all about writing async functions, so let’s start there.

An async function is defined like a normal function, except you write `async def` instead of `def`:

```python
# A regular function
def regular_double(x):
    return 2 * x

# An async function
async def async_double(x):
    return 2 * x
```

“Async” is short for “asynchronous”; we’ll sometimes refer to regular functions like `regular_double` as “synchronous functions”, to distinguish them from async functions.

From a user’s point of view, there are two differences between an async function and a regular function:

1. To call an async function, you have to use the `await` keyword. So instead of writing `regular_double(3)`, you write `await async_double(3)`.
2. You can’t use the `await` keyword inside the body of a regular function. If you try it, you’ll get a syntax error: def print_double(x): print(await async_double(x)) # <-- SyntaxError here But inside an async function, `await` is allowed: async def print_double(x): print(await async_double(x)) # <-- OK!

Now, let’s think about the consequences here: if you need `await` to call an async function, and only async functions can use `await`… here’s a little table:

| If a function like this | wants to call a function like this | is it gonna happen? |
|---|---|---|
| sync | sync | ✓ |
| sync | async | **NOPE** |
| async | sync | ✓ |
| async | async | ✓ |

So in summary: As a user, the entire advantage of async functions over regular functions is that async functions have a superpower: they can call other async functions.

This immediately raises two questions: how, and why? Specifically:

When your Python program starts up, it’s running regular old sync code. So there’s a chicken-and-the-egg problem: once we’re running an async function we can call other async functions, but *how* do we call that first async function?

And, if the only reason to write an async function is that it can call other async functions, *why* on earth would we ever use them in the first place? I mean, as superpowers go this seems a bit pointless. Wouldn’t it be simpler to just… not use any async functions at all?

This is where an async library like Trio comes in. It provides two things:

1. A runner function, which is a special *synchronous* function that takes and calls an *asynchronous* function. In Trio, this is `trio.run`: import trio async def async_double(x): return 2 * x trio.run(async_double, 3) # returns 6 So that answers the “how” part.
2. A bunch of useful async functions – in particular, functions for doing I/O. So that answers the “why”: these functions are async, and they’re useful, so if you want to use them, you have to write async code. If you think keeping track of these `async` and `await` things is annoying, then too bad – you’ve got no choice in the matter! (Well, OK, you could just not use Trio. That’s a legitimate option. But it turns out that the `async/await` stuff is actually a good thing, for reasons we’ll discuss a little bit later.) Here’s an example function that uses `trio.sleep()`. (`trio.sleep()` is like `time.sleep()`, but with more async.) import trio async def double_sleep(x): await trio.sleep(2 * x) trio.run(double_sleep, 3) # does nothing for 6 seconds then returns

So it turns out our `async_double` function is actually a bad example. I mean, it works, it’s fine, there’s nothing *wrong* with it, but it’s pointless: it could just as easily be written as a regular function, and it would be more useful that way. `double_sleep` is a much more typical example: we have to make it async, because it calls another async function. The end result is a kind of async sandwich, with Trio on both sides and our code in the middle:

```
trio.run -> double_sleep -> trio.sleep
```

This “sandwich” structure is typical for async code; in general, it looks like:

```
trio.run -> [async function] -> ... -> [async function] -> trio.whatever
```

It’s exactly the functions on the path between `trio.run()` and `trio.whatever` that have to be async. Trio provides the async bread, and then your code makes up the async sandwich’s tasty async filling. Other functions (e.g., helpers you call along the way) should generally be regular, non-async functions.

### Warning: don’t forget that `await`!

Now would be a good time to open up a Python prompt and experiment a little with writing simple async functions and running them with `trio.run`.

At some point in this process, you’ll probably write some code like this, that tries to call an async function but leaves out the `await`:

```python
import time
import trio

async def broken_double_sleep(x):
    print("*yawn* Going to sleep")
    start_time = time.perf_counter()

    # Whoops, we forgot the 'await'!
    trio.sleep(2 * x)

    sleep_time = time.perf_counter() - start_time
    print(f"Woke up after {sleep_time:.2f} seconds, feeling well rested!")

trio.run(broken_double_sleep, 3)
```

You might think that Python would raise an error here, like it does for other kinds of mistakes we sometimes make when calling a function. Like, if we forgot to pass `trio.sleep()` its required argument, then we would get a nice `TypeError` saying so. But unfortunately, if you forget an `await`, you don’t get that. What you actually get is:

```pycon
>>> trio.run(broken_double_sleep, 3)
*yawn* Going to sleep
Woke up after 0.00 seconds, feeling well rested!
__main__:4: RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'sleep' was never awaited
>>>
```

This is clearly broken – 0.00 seconds is not long enough to feel well rested! Yet the code acts like it succeeded – no exception was raised. The only clue that something went wrong is that it prints `RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'sleep' was never awaited`. Also, the exact place where the warning is printed might vary, because it depends on the whims of the garbage collector. If you’re using PyPy, you might not even get a warning at all until the next GC collection runs:

```pycon
# On PyPy:
>>> trio.run(broken_double_sleep, 3)
*yawn* Going to sleep
Woke up after 0.00 seconds, feeling well rested!
>>> # what the ... ?? not even a warning!

>>> # but forcing a garbage collection gives us a warning:
>>> import gc
>>> gc.collect()
/home/njs/pypy-3.8-nightly/lib-python/3/importlib/_bootstrap.py:191: RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'sleep' was never awaited
if _module_locks.get(name) is wr:    # XXX PyPy fix?
0
```

(If you can’t see the warning above, try scrolling right.)

Forgetting an `await` like this is an *incredibly common mistake*. You will mess this up. Everyone does. And Python will not help you as much as you’d hope 😞. The key thing to remember is: if you see the magic words `RuntimeWarning: coroutine '...' was never awaited`, then this *always* means that you made the mistake of leaving out an `await` somewhere, and you should ignore all the other error messages you see and go fix that first, because there’s a good chance the other stuff is just collateral damage. I’m not even sure what all that other junk in the PyPy output is. Fortunately I don’t need to know, I just need to fix my function!

(“I thought you said you weren’t going to mention coroutines!” Yes, well, *I* didn’t mention coroutines, Python did. Take it up with Guido! But seriously, this is unfortunately a place where the internal implementation details do leak out a bit.)

Why does this happen? In Trio, every time we use `await` it’s to call an async function, and every time we call an async function we use `await`. But Python’s trying to keep its options open for other libraries that are *ahem* a little less organized about things. So while for our purposes we can think of `await trio.sleep(...)` as a single piece of syntax, Python thinks of it as two things: first a function call that returns this weird “coroutine” object:

```pycon
>>> trio.sleep(3)
<coroutine object sleep at 0x7f5ac77be6d0>
```

and then that object gets passed to `await`, which actually runs the function. So if you forget `await`, then two bad things happen: your function doesn’t actually get called, and you get a “coroutine” object where you might have been expecting something else, like a number:

```pycon
>>> async_double(3) + 1
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'coroutine' and 'int'
```

If you didn’t already mess this up naturally, then give it a try on purpose: try writing some code with a missing `await`, or an extra `await`, and see what you get. This way you’ll be prepared for when it happens to you for real.

And remember: watch out for `RuntimeWarning: coroutine '...' was never awaited`; it means you need to find and fix your missing `await`.

### Okay, let’s see something cool already

So now we’ve started using Trio, but so far all we’ve learned to do is write functions that print things and sleep for various lengths of time. Interesting enough, but we could just as easily have done that with `time.sleep()`. `async/await` is useless!

Well, not really. Trio has one more trick up its sleeve, that makes async functions more powerful than regular functions: it can run multiple async functions *at the same time*. Here’s an example:

```python3
 1# tasks-intro.py
 2
 3import trio
 4
 5
 6async def child1():
 7    print("  child1: started! sleeping now...")
 8    await trio.sleep(1)
 9    print("  child1: exiting!")
10
11
12async def child2():
13    print("  child2: started! sleeping now...")
14    await trio.sleep(1)
15    print("  child2: exiting!")
16
17
18async def parent():
19    print("parent: started!")
20    async with trio.open_nursery() as nursery:
21        print("parent: spawning child1...")
22        nursery.start_soon(child1)
23
24        print("parent: spawning child2...")
25        nursery.start_soon(child2)
26
27        print("parent: waiting for children to finish...")
28        # -- we exit the nursery block here --
29    print("parent: all done!")
30
31
32trio.run(parent)
```

There’s a lot going on in here, so we’ll take it one step at a time. In the first part, we define two async functions `child1` and `child2`. These should look familiar from the last section:

```python3
 6async def child1():
 7    print("  child1: started! sleeping now...")
 8    await trio.sleep(1)
 9    print("  child1: exiting!")
10
11
12async def child2():
13    print("  child2: started! sleeping now...")
14    await trio.sleep(1)
15    print("  child2: exiting!")
```

Next, we define `parent` as an async function that’s going to call `child1` and `child2` concurrently:

```python3
18async def parent():
19    print("parent: started!")
20    async with trio.open_nursery() as nursery:
21        print("parent: spawning child1...")
22        nursery.start_soon(child1)
23
24        print("parent: spawning child2...")
25        nursery.start_soon(child2)
26
27        print("parent: waiting for children to finish...")
28        # -- we exit the nursery block here --
29    print("parent: all done!")
```

It does this by using a mysterious `async with` statement to create a “nursery”, and then “spawns” `child1` and `child2` into the nursery.

Let’s start with this `async with` thing. It’s actually pretty simple. In regular Python, a statement like `with someobj: ...` instructs the interpreter to call `someobj.__enter__()` at the beginning of the block, and to call `someobj.__exit__()` at the end of the block. We call `someobj` a “context manager”. An `async with` does exactly the same thing, except that where a regular `with` statement calls regular methods, an `async with` statement calls async methods: at the start of the block it does `await someobj.__aenter__()` and at that end of the block it does `await someobj.__aexit__()`. In this case we call `someobj` an “async context manager”. So in short: `with` blocks are a shorthand for calling some functions, and since with async/await Python now has two kinds of functions, it also needs two kinds of `with` blocks. That’s all there is to it! If you understand async functions, then you understand `async with`.

Note

This example doesn’t use them, but while we’re here we might as well mention the one other piece of new syntax that async/await added: `async for`. It’s basically the same idea as `async with` versus `with`: An `async for` loop is just like a `for` loop, except that where a `for` loop does `iterator.__next__()` to fetch the next item, an `async for` does `await async_iterator.__anext__()`. Now you understand all of async/await. Basically just remember that it involves making sandwiches and sticking the word “async” in front of everything, and you’ll do fine.

Now that we understand `async with`, let’s look at `parent` again:

```python3
18async def parent():
19    print("parent: started!")
20    async with trio.open_nursery() as nursery:
21        print("parent: spawning child1...")
22        nursery.start_soon(child1)
23
24        print("parent: spawning child2...")
25        nursery.start_soon(child2)
26
27        print("parent: waiting for children to finish...")
28        # -- we exit the nursery block here --
29    print("parent: all done!")
```

There are only 4 lines of code that really do anything here. On line 20, we use `trio.open_nursery()` to get a “nursery” object, and then inside the `async with` block we call `nursery.start_soon` twice, on lines 22 and 25. There are actually two ways to call an async function: the first one is the one we already saw, using `await async_fn()`; the new one is `nursery.start_soon(async_fn)`: it asks Trio to start running this async function, *but then returns immediately without waiting for the function to finish*. So after our two calls to `nursery.start_soon`, `child1` and `child2` are now running in the background. And then at line 28, the commented line, we hit the end of the `async with` block, and the nursery’s `__aexit__` function runs. What this does is force `parent` to stop here and wait for all the children in the nursery to exit. This is why you have to use `async with` to get a nursery: it gives us a way to make sure that the child calls can’t run away and get lost. One reason this is important is that if there’s a bug or other problem in one of the children, and it raises an exception, then it lets us propagate that exception into the parent; in many other frameworks, exceptions like this are just discarded. Trio never discards exceptions.

Ok! Let’s try running it and see what we get:

```
parent: started!
parent: spawning child1...
parent: spawning child2...
parent: waiting for children to finish...
  child2: started! sleeping now...
  child1: started! sleeping now...
    [... 1 second passes ...]
  child1: exiting!
  child2: exiting!
parent: all done!
```

(Your output might have the order of the “started” and/or “exiting” lines swapped compared to mine.)

Notice that `child1` and `child2` both start together and then both exit together. And, even though we made two calls to `trio.sleep(1)`, the program finished in just one second total. So it looks like `child1` and `child2` really are running at the same time!

Now, if you’re familiar with programming using threads, this might look familiar – and that’s intentional. But it’s important to realize that *there are no threads here*. All of this is happening in a single thread. To remind ourselves of this, we use slightly different terminology: instead of spawning two “threads”, we say that we spawned two “tasks”. There are two differences between tasks and threads: (1) many tasks can take turns running on a single thread, and (2) with threads, the Python interpreter/operating system can switch which thread is running whenever they feel like it; with tasks, we can only switch at certain designated places we call “checkpoints”. In the next section, we’ll dig into what this means.

### Task switching illustrated

The big idea behind async/await-based libraries like Trio is to run lots of tasks simultaneously on a single thread by switching between them at appropriate places – so for example, if we’re implementing a web server, then one task could be sending an HTTP response at the same time as another task is waiting for new connections. If all you want to do is use Trio, then you don’t need to understand all the nitty-gritty detail of how this switching works – but it’s very useful to have at least a general intuition about what Trio is doing “under the hood” when your code is executing. To help build that intuition, let’s look more closely at how Trio ran our example from the last section.

Fortunately, Trio provides a rich set of tools for inspecting and debugging your programs. Here we want to watch `trio.run()` at work, which we can do by writing a class we’ll call `Tracer`, which implements Trio’s `Instrument` interface. Its job is to log various events as they happen:

```python3
class Tracer(trio.abc.Instrument):
    def before_run(self):
        print("!!! run started")

    def _print_with_task(self, msg, task):
        # repr(task) is perhaps more useful than task.name in general,
        # but in context of a tutorial the extra noise is unhelpful.
        print(f"{msg}: {task.name}")

    def task_spawned(self, task):
        self._print_with_task("### new task spawned", task)

    def task_scheduled(self, task):
        self._print_with_task("### task scheduled", task)

    def before_task_step(self, task):
        self._print_with_task(">>> about to run one step of task", task)

    def after_task_step(self, task):
        self._print_with_task("<<< task step finished", task)

    def task_exited(self, task):
        self._print_with_task("### task exited", task)

    def before_io_wait(self, timeout):
        if timeout:
            print(f"### waiting for I/O for up to {timeout} seconds")
        else:
            print("### doing a quick check for I/O")
        self._sleep_time = trio.current_time()

    def after_io_wait(self, timeout):
        duration = trio.current_time() - self._sleep_time
        print(f"### finished I/O check (took {duration} seconds)")

    def after_run(self):
        print("!!! run finished")
```

Then we re-run our example program from the previous section, but this time we pass `trio.run()` a `Tracer` object:

```python3
trio.run(parent, instruments=[Tracer()])
```

This generates a *lot* of output, so we’ll go through it one step at a time.

First, there’s a bit of chatter while Trio gets ready to run our code. Most of this is irrelevant to us for now, but in the middle you can see that Trio has created a task for the `__main__.parent` function, and “scheduled” it (i.e., made a note that it should be run soon):

```
$ python3 tutorial/tasks-with-trace.py
!!! run started
### new task spawned: <init>
### task scheduled: <init>
### doing a quick check for I/O
### finished I/O check (took 1.1122087016701698e-05 seconds)
>>> about to run one step of task: <init>
### new task spawned: <call soon task>
### task scheduled: <call soon task>
### new task spawned: __main__.parent
### task scheduled: __main__.parent
<<< task step finished: <init>
### doing a quick check for I/O
### finished I/O check (took 6.4980704337358475e-06 seconds)
```

Once the initial housekeeping is done, Trio starts running the `parent` function, and you can see `parent` creating the two child tasks. Then it hits the end of the `async with` block, and pauses:

```
>>> about to run one step of task: __main__.parent
parent: started!
parent: spawning child1...
### new task spawned: __main__.child1
### task scheduled: __main__.child1
parent: spawning child2...
### new task spawned: __main__.child2
### task scheduled: __main__.child2
parent: waiting for children to finish...
<<< task step finished: __main__.parent
```

Control then goes back to `trio.run()`, which logs a bit more internal chatter:

```
>>> about to run one step of task: <call soon task>
<<< task step finished: <call soon task>
### doing a quick check for I/O
### finished I/O check (took 5.476875230669975e-06 seconds)
```

And then gives the two child tasks a chance to run:

```
>>> about to run one step of task: __main__.child2
  child2 started! sleeping now...
<<< task step finished: __main__.child2

>>> about to run one step of task: __main__.child1
  child1: started! sleeping now...
<<< task step finished: __main__.child1
```

Each task runs until it hits the call to `trio.sleep()`, and then suddenly we’re back in `trio.run()` deciding what to run next. How does this happen? The secret is that `trio.run()` and `trio.sleep()` work together to make it happen: `trio.sleep()` has access to some special magic that lets it pause itself, so it sends a note to `trio.run()` requesting to be woken again after 1 second, and then suspends the task. And once the task is suspended, Python gives control back to `trio.run()`, which decides what to do next. (If this sounds similar to the way that generators can suspend execution by doing a `yield`, then that’s not a coincidence: inside the Python interpreter, there’s a lot of overlap between the implementation of generators and async functions.)

Note

You might wonder whether you can mix-and-match primitives from different async libraries. For example, could we use `trio.run()` together with `asyncio.sleep()`? The answer is no, we can’t, and the paragraph above explains why: the two sides of our async sandwich have a private language they use to talk to each other, and different libraries use different languages. So if you try to call `asyncio.sleep()` from inside a `trio.run()`, then Trio will get very confused indeed and probably blow up in some dramatic way.

Only async functions have access to the special magic for suspending a task, so only async functions can cause the program to switch to a different task. What this means is that if a call *doesn’t* have an `await` on it, then you know that it *can’t* be a place where your task will be suspended. This makes tasks much easier to reason about than threads, because there are far fewer ways that tasks can be interleaved with each other and stomp on each others’ state. (For example, in Trio a statement like `a += 1` is always atomic – even if `a` is some arbitrarily complicated custom object!) Trio also makes some further guarantees beyond that, but that’s the big one.

And now you also know why `parent` had to use an `async with` to open the nursery: if we had used a regular `with` block, then it wouldn’t have been able to pause at the end and wait for the children to finish; we need our cleanup function to be async, which is exactly what `async with` gives us.

Now, back to our execution point. To recap: at this point `parent` is waiting on `child1` and `child2`, and both children are sleeping. So `trio.run()` checks its notes, and sees that there’s nothing to be done until those sleeps finish – unless possibly some external I/O event comes in. If that happened, then it might give us something to do. Of course we aren’t doing any I/O here so it won’t happen, but in other situations it could. So next it calls an operating system primitive to put the whole process to sleep:

```
### waiting for I/O for up to 0.9999009938910604 seconds
```

And in fact no I/O does arrive, so one second later we wake up again, and Trio checks its notes again. At this point it checks the current time, compares it to the notes that `trio.sleep()` sent saying when the two child tasks should be woken up again, and realizes that they’ve slept for long enough, so it schedules them to run soon:

```
### finished I/O check (took 1.0006483688484877 seconds)
### task scheduled: __main__.child1
### task scheduled: __main__.child2
```

And then the children get to run, and this time they run to completion. Remember how `parent` is waiting for them to finish? Notice how `parent` gets scheduled when the first child exits:

```
>>> about to run one step of task: __main__.child1
  child1: exiting!
### task scheduled: __main__.parent
### task exited: __main__.child1
<<< task step finished: __main__.child1

>>> about to run one step of task: __main__.child2
  child2 exiting!
### task exited: __main__.child2
<<< task step finished: __main__.child2
```

Then, after another check for I/O, `parent` wakes up. The nursery cleanup code notices that all its children have exited, and lets the nursery block finish. And then `parent` makes a final print and exits:

```
### doing a quick check for I/O
### finished I/O check (took 9.045004844665527e-06 seconds)

>>> about to run one step of task: __main__.parent
parent: all done!
### task scheduled: <init>
### task exited: __main__.parent
<<< task step finished: __main__.parent
```

And finally, after a bit more internal bookkeeping, `trio.run()` exits too:

```
### doing a quick check for I/O
### finished I/O check (took 5.996786057949066e-06 seconds)
>>> about to run one step of task: <init>
### task scheduled: <call soon task>
### task scheduled: <init>
<<< task step finished: <init>
### doing a quick check for I/O
### finished I/O check (took 6.258022040128708e-06 seconds)
>>> about to run one step of task: <call soon task>
### task exited: <call soon task>
<<< task step finished: <call soon task>
>>> about to run one step of task: <init>
### task exited: <init>
<<< task step finished: <init>
!!! run finished
```

You made it!

That was a lot of text, but again, you don’t need to understand everything here to use Trio – in fact, Trio goes to great lengths to make each task feel like it executes in a simple, linear way. (Just like your operating system goes to great lengths to make it feel like your single-threaded code executes in a simple linear way, even though under the covers the operating system juggles between different threads and processes in essentially the same way Trio does.) But it is useful to have a rough model in your head of how the code you write is actually executed, and – most importantly – the consequences of that for parallelism.

Alternatively, if this has just whetted your appetite and you want to know more about how `async/await` works internally, then this blog post is a good deep dive, or check out this great walkthrough to see how to build a simple async I/O framework from the ground up.


## A kinder, gentler GIL

Speaking of parallelism – let’s zoom out for a moment and talk about how async/await compares to other ways of handling concurrency in Python.

As we’ve already noted, Trio tasks are conceptually rather similar to Python’s built-in threads, as provided by the `threading` module. And in all common Python implementations, threads have a famous limitation: the Global Interpreter Lock, or “GIL” for short. The GIL means that even if you use multiple threads, your code still (mostly) ends up running on a single core. People tend to find this frustrating.

But from Trio’s point of view, the problem with the GIL isn’t that it restricts parallelism. Of course it would be nice if Python had better options for taking advantage of multiple cores, but that’s an extremely difficult problem to solve, and in the meantime there are lots of problems where a single core is totally adequate – or where if it isn’t, then process-level or machine-level parallelism works fine.

No, the problem with the GIL is that it’s a *lousy deal*: we give up on using multiple cores, and in exchange we get… almost all the same challenges and mind-bending bugs that come with real parallel programming, and – to add insult to injury – pretty poor scalability. Threads in Python just aren’t that appealing.

Trio doesn’t make your code run on multiple cores; in fact, as we saw above, it’s baked into Trio’s design that when it has multiple tasks, they take turns, so at each moment only one of them is actively running. We’re not so much overcoming the GIL as embracing it. But if you’re willing to accept that, plus a bit of extra work to put these new `async` and `await` keywords in the right places, then in exchange you get:

- Excellent scalability: Trio can run 10,000+ tasks simultaneously without breaking a sweat, so long as their total CPU demands don’t exceed what a single core can provide. (This is common in, for example, network servers that have lots of clients connected, but only a few active at any given time.)
- Fancy features: most threading systems are implemented in C and restricted to whatever features the operating system provides. In Trio our logic is all in Python, which makes it possible to implement powerful and ergonomic features like Trio’s cancellation system.
- Code that’s easier to reason about: the `await` keyword means that potential task-switching points are explicitly marked within each function. This can make Trio code dramatically easier to reason about than the equivalent program using threads.

Certainly it’s not appropriate for every app… but there are a lot of situations where the trade-offs here look pretty appealing.

There is one downside that’s important to keep in mind, though. Making checkpoints explicit gives you more control over how your tasks can be interleaved – but with great power comes great responsibility. With threads, the runtime environment is responsible for making sure that each thread gets its fair share of running time. With Trio, if some task runs off and does stuff for seconds on end without executing a checkpoint, then… all your other tasks will just have to wait.

Here’s an example of how this can go wrong. Take our example from above, and replace the calls to `trio.sleep()` with calls to `time.sleep()`. If we run our modified program, we’ll see something like:

```
parent: started!
parent: spawning child1...
parent: spawning child2...
parent: waiting for children to finish...
  child2 started! sleeping now...
    [... pauses for 1 second ...]
  child2 exiting!
  child1: started! sleeping now...
    [... pauses for 1 second ...]
  child1: exiting!
parent: all done!
```

One of the major reasons why Trio has such a rich instrumentation API is to make it possible to write debugging tools to catch issues like this.
