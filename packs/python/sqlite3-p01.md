# `sqlite3` — DB-API 2.0 interface for SQLite databases

**Source code:** Lib/sqlite3/

SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate server process and allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. Some applications can use SQLite for internal data storage. It’s also possible to prototype an application using SQLite and then port the code to a larger database such as PostgreSQL or Oracle.

The `sqlite3` module was written by Gerhard Häring. It provides an SQL interface compliant with the DB-API 2.0 specification described by **PEP 249**, and requires the third-party SQLite library.

This is an optional module. If it is missing from your copy of CPython, look for documentation from your distributor (that is, whoever provided Python to you). If you are the distributor, see Requirements for optional modules.

This document includes four main sections:

- Tutorial teaches how to use the `sqlite3` module.
- Reference describes the classes and functions this module defines.
- How-to guides details how to handle specific tasks.
- Explanation provides in-depth background on transaction control.

## Tutorial

In this tutorial, you will create a database of Monty Python movies using basic `sqlite3` functionality. It assumes a fundamental understanding of database concepts, including cursors and transactions.

First, we need to create a new database and open a database connection to allow `sqlite3` to work with it. Call `sqlite3.connect()` to create a connection to the database `tutorial.db` in the current working directory, implicitly creating it if it does not exist:

```python
import sqlite3
con = sqlite3.connect("tutorial.db")
```

The returned `Connection` object `con` represents the connection to the on-disk database.

In order to execute SQL statements and fetch results from SQL queries, we will need to use a database cursor. Call `con.cursor()` to create the `Cursor`:

```python
cur = con.cursor()
```

Now that we’ve got a database connection and a cursor, we can create a database table `movie` with columns for title, release year, and review score. For simplicity, we can just use column names in the table declaration – thanks to the flexible typing feature of SQLite, specifying the data types is optional. Execute the `CREATE TABLE` statement by calling `cur.execute(...)`:

```python
cur.execute("CREATE TABLE movie(title, year, score)")
```

We can verify that the new table has been created by querying the `sqlite_master` table built-in to SQLite, which should now contain an entry for the `movie` table definition (see The Schema Table for details). Execute that query by calling `cur.execute(...)`, assign the result to `res`, and call `res.fetchone()` to fetch the resulting row:

```pycon
>>> res = cur.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master")
>>> res.fetchone()
('movie',)
```

We can see that the table has been created, as the query returns a `tuple` containing the table’s name. If we query `sqlite_master` for a non-existent table `spam`, `res.fetchone()` will return `None`:

```pycon
>>> res = cur.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE name='spam'")
>>> res.fetchone() is None
True
```

Now, add two rows of data supplied as SQL literals by executing an `INSERT` statement, once again by calling `cur.execute(...)`:

```python
cur.execute("""
    INSERT INTO movie VALUES
        ('Monty Python and the Holy Grail', 1975, 8.2),
        ('And Now for Something Completely Different', 1971, 7.5)
""")
```

The `INSERT` statement implicitly opens a transaction, which needs to be committed before changes are saved in the database (see Transaction control for details). Call `con.commit()` on the connection object to commit the transaction:

```python
con.commit()
```

We can verify that the data was inserted correctly by executing a `SELECT` query. Use the now-familiar `cur.execute(...)` to assign the result to `res`, and call `res.fetchall()` to return all resulting rows:

```pycon
>>> res = cur.execute("SELECT score FROM movie")
>>> res.fetchall()
[(8.2,), (7.5,)]
```

The result is a `list` of two `tuple`s, one per row, each containing that row’s `score` value.

Now, insert three more rows by calling `cur.executemany(...)`:

```python
data = [
    ("Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl", 1982, 7.9),
    ("Monty Python's The Meaning of Life", 1983, 7.5),
    ("Monty Python's Life of Brian", 1979, 8.0),
]
cur.executemany("INSERT INTO movie VALUES(?, ?, ?)", data)
con.commit()  # Remember to commit the transaction after executing INSERT.
```

Notice that `?` placeholders are used to bind `data` to the query. Always use placeholders instead of string formatting to bind Python values to SQL statements, to avoid SQL injection attacks (see How to use placeholders to bind values in SQL queries for more details).

We can verify that the new rows were inserted by executing a `SELECT` query, this time iterating over the results of the query:

```pycon
>>> for row in cur.execute("SELECT year, title FROM movie ORDER BY year"):
...     print(row)
(1971, 'And Now for Something Completely Different')
(1975, 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail')
(1979, "Monty Python's Life of Brian")
(1982, 'Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl')
(1983, "Monty Python's The Meaning of Life")
```

Each row is a two-item `tuple` of `(year, title)`, matching the columns selected in the query.

Finally, verify that the database has been written to disk by calling `con.close()` to close the existing connection, opening a new one, creating a new cursor, then querying the database:

```pycon
>>> con.close()
>>> new_con = sqlite3.connect("tutorial.db")
>>> new_cur = new_con.cursor()
>>> res = new_cur.execute("SELECT title, year FROM movie ORDER BY score DESC")
>>> title, year = res.fetchone()
>>> print(f'The highest scoring Monty Python movie is {title!r}, released in {year}')
The highest scoring Monty Python movie is 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail', released in 1975
>>> new_con.close()
```

You’ve now created an SQLite database using the `sqlite3` module, inserted data and retrieved values from it in multiple ways.
