# `typing` — Support for type hints

Added in version 3.5.

**Source code:** Lib/typing.py

Note

The Python runtime does not enforce function and variable type annotations. They can be used by third party tools such as type checkers, IDEs, linters, etc.

This module provides runtime support for type hints.

Consider the function below:

```python3
def surface_area_of_cube(edge_length: float) -> str:
    return f"The surface area of the cube is {6 * edge_length ** 2}."
```

The function `surface_area_of_cube` takes an argument expected to be an instance of `float`, as indicated by the type hint `edge_length: float`. The function is expected to return an instance of `str`, as indicated by the `-> str` hint.

While type hints can be simple classes like `float` or `str`, they can also be more complex. The `typing` module provides a vocabulary of more advanced type hints.

New features are frequently added to the `typing` module. The typing_extensions package provides backports of these new features to older versions of Python.

## Specification for the Python Type System

The canonical, up-to-date specification of the Python type system can be found at Specification for the Python type system.


## Type aliases

A type alias is defined using the `type` statement, which creates an instance of `TypeAliasType`. In this example, `Vector` and `list[float]` will be treated equivalently by static type checkers:

```python3
type Vector = list[float]

def scale(scalar: float, vector: Vector) -> Vector:
    return [scalar * num for num in vector]

# passes type checking; a list of floats qualifies as a Vector.
new_vector = scale(2.0, [1.0, -4.2, 5.4])
```

Type aliases are useful for simplifying complex type signatures. For example:

```python3
from collections.abc import Sequence

type ConnectionOptions = dict[str, str]
type Address = tuple[str, int]
type Server = tuple[Address, ConnectionOptions]

def broadcast_message(message: str, servers: Sequence[Server]) -> None:
    ...

# The static type checker will treat the previous type signature as
# being exactly equivalent to this one.
def broadcast_message(
    message: str,
    servers: Sequence[tuple[tuple[str, int], dict[str, str]]]
) -> None:
    ...
```

The `type` statement is new in Python 3.12. For backwards compatibility, type aliases can also be created through simple assignment:

```python3
Vector = list[float]
```

Or marked with `TypeAlias` to make it explicit that this is a type alias, not a normal variable assignment:

```python3
from typing import TypeAlias

Vector: TypeAlias = list[float]
```


## NewType

Use the `NewType` helper to create distinct types:

```python3
from typing import NewType

UserId = NewType('UserId', int)
some_id = UserId(524313)
```

The static type checker will treat the new type as if it were a subclass of the original type. This is useful in helping catch logical errors:

```python3
def get_user_name(user_id: UserId) -> str:
    ...

# passes type checking
user_a = get_user_name(UserId(42351))

# fails type checking; an int is not a UserId
user_b = get_user_name(-1)
```

You may still perform all `int` operations on a variable of type `UserId`, but the result will always be of type `int`. This lets you pass in a `UserId` wherever an `int` might be expected, but will prevent you from accidentally creating a `UserId` in an invalid way:

```python3
# 'output' is of type 'int', not 'UserId'
output = UserId(23413) + UserId(54341)
```

Note that these checks are enforced only by the static type checker. At runtime, the statement `Derived = NewType('Derived', Base)` will make `Derived` a callable that immediately returns whatever parameter you pass it. That means the expression `Derived(some_value)` does not create a new class or introduce much overhead beyond that of a regular function call.

More precisely, the expression `some_value is Derived(some_value)` is always true at runtime.

It is invalid to create a subtype of `Derived`:

```python3
from typing import NewType

UserId = NewType('UserId', int)

# Fails at runtime and does not pass type checking
class AdminUserId(UserId): pass
```

However, it is possible to create a `NewType` based on a ‘derived’ `NewType`:

```python3
from typing import NewType

UserId = NewType('UserId', int)

ProUserId = NewType('ProUserId', UserId)
```

and typechecking for `ProUserId` will work as expected.

See **PEP 484** for more details.

Note

Recall that the use of a type alias declares two types to be *equivalent* to one another. Doing `type Alias = Original` will make the static type checker treat `Alias` as being *exactly equivalent* to `Original` in all cases. This is useful when you want to simplify complex type signatures.

In contrast, `NewType` declares one type to be a *subtype* of another. Doing `Derived = NewType('Derived', Original)` will make the static type checker treat `Derived` as a *subclass* of `Original`, which means a value of type `Original` cannot be used in places where a value of type `Derived` is expected. This is useful when you want to prevent logic errors with minimal runtime cost.

Added in version 3.5.2.

Changed in version 3.10: `NewType` is now a class rather than a function. As a result, there is some additional runtime cost when calling `NewType` over a regular function.

Changed in version 3.11: The performance of calling `NewType` has been restored to its level in Python 3.9.


## Annotating callable objects

Functions – or other callable objects – can be annotated using `collections.abc.Callable` or deprecated `typing.Callable`. `Callable[[int], str]` signifies a function that takes a single parameter of type `int` and returns a `str`.

For example:

```python
from collections.abc import Callable, Awaitable

def feeder(get_next_item: Callable[[], str]) -> None:
    ...  # Body

def async_query(on_success: Callable[[int], None],
                on_error: Callable[[int, Exception], None]) -> None:
    ...  # Body

async def on_update(value: str) -> None:
    ...  # Body

callback: Callable[[str], Awaitable[None]] = on_update
```

The subscription syntax must always be used with exactly two values: the argument list and the return type. The argument list must be a list of types, a `ParamSpec`, `Concatenate`, or an ellipsis (`...`). The return type must be a single type.

If a literal ellipsis `...` is given as the argument list, it indicates that a callable with any arbitrary parameter list would be acceptable:

```python
def concat(x: str, y: str) -> str:
    return x + y

x: Callable[..., str]
x = str     # OK
x = concat  # Also OK
```

`Callable` cannot express complex signatures such as functions that take a variadic number of arguments, overloaded functions, or functions that have keyword-only parameters. However, these signatures can be expressed by defining a `Protocol` class with a `__call__()` method:

```python
from collections.abc import Iterable
from typing import Protocol

class Combiner(Protocol):
    def __call__(self, *vals: bytes, maxlen: int | None = None) -> list[bytes]: ...

def batch_proc(data: Iterable[bytes], cb_results: Combiner) -> bytes:
    for item in data:
        ...

def good_cb(*vals: bytes, maxlen: int | None = None) -> list[bytes]:
    ...
def bad_cb(*vals: bytes, maxitems: int | None) -> list[bytes]:
    ...

batch_proc([], good_cb)  # OK
batch_proc([], bad_cb)   # Error! Argument 2 has incompatible type because of
                         # different name and kind in the callback
```

Callables which take other callables as arguments may indicate that their parameter types are dependent on each other using `ParamSpec`. Additionally, if that callable adds or removes arguments from other callables, the `Concatenate` operator may be used. They take the form `Callable[ParamSpecVariable, ReturnType]` and `Callable[Concatenate[Arg1Type, Arg2Type, ..., ParamSpecVariable], ReturnType]` respectively.

Changed in version 3.10: `Callable` now supports `ParamSpec` and `Concatenate`. See **PEP 612** for more details.

See also

The documentation for `ParamSpec` and `Concatenate` provides examples of usage in `Callable`.


## Generics

Since type information about objects kept in containers cannot be statically inferred in a generic way, many container classes in the standard library support subscription to denote the expected types of container elements.

```python
from collections.abc import Mapping, Sequence

class Employee: ...

# Sequence[Employee] indicates that all elements in the sequence
# must be instances of "Employee".
# Mapping[str, str] indicates that all keys and all values in the mapping
# must be strings.
def notify_by_email(employees: Sequence[Employee],
                    overrides: Mapping[str, str]) -> None: ...
```

Generic functions and classes can be parameterized by using type parameter syntax:

```python3
from collections.abc import Sequence

def first[T](l: Sequence[T]) -> T:  # Function is generic over the TypeVar "T"
    return l[0]
```

Or by using the `TypeVar` factory directly:

```python3
from collections.abc import Sequence
from typing import TypeVar

U = TypeVar('U')                  # Declare type variable "U"

def second(l: Sequence[U]) -> U:  # Function is generic over the TypeVar "U"
    return l[1]
```

Changed in version 3.12: Syntactic support for generics is new in Python 3.12.


## Annotating tuples

For most containers in Python, the typing system assumes that all elements in the container will be of the same type. For example:

```python3
from collections.abc import Mapping

# Type checker will infer that all elements in ``x`` are meant to be ints
x: list[int] = []

# Type checker error: ``list`` only accepts a single type argument:
y: list[int, str] = [1, 'foo']

# Type checker will infer that all keys in ``z`` are meant to be strings,
# and that all values in ``z`` are meant to be either strings or ints
z: Mapping[str, str | int] = {}
```

`list` only accepts one type argument, so a type checker would emit an error on the `y` assignment above. Similarly, `Mapping` only accepts two type arguments: the first indicates the type of the keys, and the second indicates the type of the values.

Unlike most other Python containers, however, it is common in idiomatic Python code for tuples to have elements which are not all of the same type. For this reason, tuples are special-cased in Python’s typing system. `tuple` accepts *any number* of type arguments:

```python3
# OK: ``x`` is assigned to a tuple of length 1 where the sole element is an int
x: tuple[int] = (5,)

# OK: ``y`` is assigned to a tuple of length 2;
# element 1 is an int, element 2 is a str
y: tuple[int, str] = (5, "foo")

# Error: the type annotation indicates a tuple of length 1,
# but ``z`` has been assigned to a tuple of length 3
z: tuple[int] = (1, 2, 3)
```

To denote a tuple which could be of *any* length, and in which all elements are of the same type `T`, use the literal ellipsis `...`: `tuple[T, ...]`. To denote an empty tuple, use `tuple[()]`. Using plain `tuple` as an annotation is equivalent to using `tuple[Any, ...]`:

```python3
x: tuple[int, ...] = (1, 2)
# These reassignments are OK: ``tuple[int, ...]`` indicates x can be of any length
x = (1, 2, 3)
x = ()
# This reassignment is an error: all elements in ``x`` must be ints
x = ("foo", "bar")

# ``y`` can only ever be assigned to an empty tuple
y: tuple[()] = ()

z: tuple = ("foo", "bar")
# These reassignments are OK: plain ``tuple`` is equivalent to ``tuple[Any, ...]``
z = (1, 2, 3)
z = ()
```


## The type of class objects

A variable annotated with `C` may accept a value of type `C`. In contrast, a variable annotated with `type[C]` (or deprecated `typing.Type[C]`) may accept values that are classes themselves – specifically, it will accept the *class object* of `C`. For example:

```python3
a = 3         # Has type ``int``
b = int       # Has type ``type[int]``
c = type(a)   # Also has type ``type[int]``
```

Note that `type[C]` is covariant:

```python3
class User: ...
class ProUser(User): ...
class TeamUser(User): ...

def make_new_user(user_class: type[User]) -> User:
    # ...
    return user_class()

make_new_user(User)      # OK
make_new_user(ProUser)   # Also OK: ``type[ProUser]`` is a subtype of ``type[User]``
make_new_user(TeamUser)  # Still fine
make_new_user(User())    # Error: expected ``type[User]`` but got ``User``
make_new_user(int)       # Error: ``type[int]`` is not a subtype of ``type[User]``
```

The only legal parameters for `type` are classes, `Any`, type variables, and unions of any of these types. For example:

```python3
def new_non_team_user(user_class: type[BasicUser | ProUser]): ...

new_non_team_user(BasicUser)  # OK
new_non_team_user(ProUser)    # OK
new_non_team_user(TeamUser)   # Error: ``type[TeamUser]`` is not a subtype
                              # of ``type[BasicUser | ProUser]``
new_non_team_user(User)       # Also an error
```

`type[Any]` is equivalent to `type`, which is the root of Python’s metaclass hierarchy.


## Annotating generators and coroutines

A generator can be annotated using the generic type `Generator[YieldType, SendType, ReturnType]`. For example:

```python3
def echo_round() -> Generator[int, float, str]:
    sent = yield 0
    while sent >= 0:
        sent = yield round(sent)
    return 'Done'
```

Note that unlike many other generic classes in the standard library, the `SendType` of `Generator` behaves contravariantly, not covariantly or invariantly.

The `SendType` and `ReturnType` parameters default to `None`:

```python3
def infinite_stream(start: int) -> Generator[int]:
    while True:
        yield start
        start += 1
```

It is also possible to set these types explicitly:

```python3
def infinite_stream(start: int) -> Generator[int, None, None]:
    while True:
        yield start
        start += 1
```

Simple generators that only ever yield values can also be annotated as having a return type of either `Iterable[YieldType]` or `Iterator[YieldType]`:

```python3
def infinite_stream(start: int) -> Iterator[int]:
    while True:
        yield start
        start += 1
```

Async generators are handled in a similar fashion, but don’t expect a `ReturnType` type argument (`AsyncGenerator[YieldType, SendType]`). The `SendType` argument defaults to `None`, so the following definitions are equivalent:

```python3
async def infinite_stream(start: int) -> AsyncGenerator[int]:
    while True:
        yield start
        start = await increment(start)

async def infinite_stream(start: int) -> AsyncGenerator[int, None]:
    while True:
        yield start
        start = await increment(start)
```

As in the synchronous case, `AsyncIterable[YieldType]` and `AsyncIterator[YieldType]` are available as well:

```python3
async def infinite_stream(start: int) -> AsyncIterator[int]:
    while True:
        yield start
        start = await increment(start)
```

Coroutines can be annotated using `Coroutine[YieldType, SendType, ReturnType]`. Generic arguments correspond to those of `Generator`, for example:

```python3
from collections.abc import Coroutine
c: Coroutine[list[str], str, int]  # Some coroutine defined elsewhere
x = c.send('hi')                   # Inferred type of 'x' is list[str]
async def bar() -> None:
    y = await c                    # Inferred type of 'y' is int
```


## User-defined generic types

A user-defined class can be defined as a generic class.

```python3
from logging import Logger

class LoggedVar[T]:
    def __init__(self, value: T, name: str, logger: Logger) -> None:
        self.name = name
        self.logger = logger
        self.value = value

    def set(self, new: T) -> None:
        self.log('Set ' + repr(self.value))
        self.value = new

    def get(self) -> T:
        self.log('Get ' + repr(self.value))
        return self.value

    def log(self, message: str) -> None:
        self.logger.info('%s: %s', self.name, message)
```

This syntax indicates that the class `LoggedVar` is parameterised around a single type variable `T` . This also makes `T` valid as a type within the class body.

Generic classes implicitly inherit from `Generic`. For compatibility with Python 3.11 and lower, it is also possible to inherit explicitly from `Generic` to indicate a generic class:

```python3
from typing import TypeVar, Generic

T = TypeVar('T')

class LoggedVar(Generic[T]):
    ...
```

Generic classes have `__class_getitem__()` methods, meaning they can be parameterised at runtime (e.g. `LoggedVar[int]` below):

```python3
from collections.abc import Iterable

def zero_all_vars(vars: Iterable[LoggedVar[int]]) -> None:
    for var in vars:
        var.set(0)
```

A generic type can have any number of type variables. All varieties of `TypeVar` are permissible as parameters for a generic type:

```python3
from typing import TypeVar, Generic, Sequence

class WeirdTrio[T, B: Sequence[bytes], S: (int, str)]:
    ...

OldT = TypeVar('OldT', contravariant=True)
OldB = TypeVar('OldB', bound=Sequence[bytes], covariant=True)
OldS = TypeVar('OldS', int, str)

class OldWeirdTrio(Generic[OldT, OldB, OldS]):
    ...
```

Each type variable argument to `Generic` must be distinct. This is thus invalid:

```python3
from typing import TypeVar, Generic
...

class Pair[M, M]:  # SyntaxError
    ...

T = TypeVar('T')

class Pair(Generic[T, T]):   # INVALID
    ...
```

Generic classes can also inherit from other classes:

```python3
from collections.abc import Sized

class LinkedList[T](Sized):
    ...
```

When inheriting from generic classes, some type parameters could be fixed:

```python3
from collections.abc import Mapping

class MyDict[T](Mapping[str, T]):
    ...
```

In this case `MyDict` has a single parameter, `T`.

Using a generic class without specifying type parameters assumes `Any` for each position. In the following example, `MyIterable` is not generic but implicitly inherits from `Iterable[Any]`:

```python
from collections.abc import Iterable

class MyIterable(Iterable): # Same as Iterable[Any]
    ...
```

User-defined generic type aliases are also supported. Examples:

```python3
from collections.abc import Iterable

type Response[S] = Iterable[S] | int

# Return type here is same as Iterable[str] | int
def response(query: str) -> Response[str]:
    ...

type Vec[T] = Iterable[tuple[T, T]]

def inproduct[T: (int, float, complex)](v: Vec[T]) -> T: # Same as Iterable[tuple[T, T]]
    return sum(x*y for x, y in v)
```

For backward compatibility, generic type aliases can also be created through a simple assignment:

```python3
from collections.abc import Iterable
from typing import TypeVar

S = TypeVar("S")
Response = Iterable[S] | int
```

Changed in version 3.7: `Generic` no longer has a custom metaclass.

Changed in version 3.12: Syntactic support for generics and type aliases is new in version 3.12. Previously, generic classes had to explicitly inherit from `Generic` or contain a type variable in one of their bases.

User-defined generics for parameter expressions are also supported via parameter specification variables in the form `[**P]`. The behavior is consistent with type variables’ described above as parameter specification variables are treated by the `typing` module as a specialized type variable. The one exception to this is that a list of types can be used to substitute a `ParamSpec`:

```python3
>>> class Z[T, **P]: ...  # T is a TypeVar; P is a ParamSpec
...
>>> Z[int, [dict, float]]
__main__.Z[int, [dict, float]]
```

Classes generic over a `ParamSpec` can also be created using explicit inheritance from `Generic`. In this case, `**` is not used:

```python3
from typing import ParamSpec, Generic

P = ParamSpec('P')

class Z(Generic[P]):
    ...
```

Another difference between `TypeVar` and `ParamSpec` is that a generic with only one parameter specification variable will accept parameter lists in the forms `X[[Type1, Type2, ...]]` and also `X[Type1, Type2, ...]` for aesthetic reasons. Internally, the latter is converted to the former, so the following are equivalent:

```python3
>>> class X[**P]: ...
...
>>> X[int, str]
__main__.X[[int, str]]
>>> X[[int, str]]
__main__.X[[int, str]]
```

Note that generics with `ParamSpec` may not have correct `__parameters__` after substitution in some cases because they are intended primarily for static type checking.

Changed in version 3.10: `Generic` can now be parameterized over parameter expressions. See `ParamSpec` and **PEP 612** for more details.

A user-defined generic class can have ABCs as base classes without a metaclass conflict. Generic metaclasses are not supported. The outcome of parameterizing generics is cached, and most types in the `typing` module are hashable and comparable for equality.


## The `Any` type

A special kind of type is `Any`. A static type checker will treat every type as assignable to `Any` and `Any` as assignable to every type.

This means that it is possible to perform any operation or method call on a value of type `Any` and assign it to any variable:

```python3
from typing import Any

a: Any = None
a = []          # OK
a = 2           # OK

s: str = ''
s = a           # OK

def foo(item: Any) -> int:
    # Passes type checking; 'item' could be any type,
    # and that type might have a 'bar' method
    item.bar()
    ...
```

Notice that no type checking is performed when assigning a value of type `Any` to a more precise type. For example, the static type checker did not report an error when assigning `a` to `s` even though `s` was declared to be of type `str` and receives an `int` value at runtime!

Furthermore, all functions without a return type or parameter types will implicitly default to using `Any`:

```python3
def legacy_parser(text):
    ...
    return data

# A static type checker will treat the above
# as having the same signature as:
def legacy_parser(text: Any) -> Any:
    ...
    return data
```

This behavior allows `Any` to be used as an *escape hatch* when you need to mix dynamically and statically typed code.

Contrast the behavior of `Any` with the behavior of `object`. Similar to `Any`, every type is a subtype of `object`. However, unlike `Any`, the reverse is not true: `object` is *not* a subtype of every other type.

That means when the type of a value is `object`, a type checker will reject almost all operations on it, and assigning it to a variable (or using it as a return value) of a more specialized type is a type error. For example:

```python3
def hash_a(item: object) -> int:
    # Fails type checking; an object does not have a 'magic' method.
    item.magic()
    ...

def hash_b(item: Any) -> int:
    # Passes type checking
    item.magic()
    ...

# Passes type checking, since ints and strs are subclasses of object
hash_a(42)
hash_a("foo")

# Passes type checking, since Any is assignable to all types
hash_b(42)
hash_b("foo")
```

Use `object` to indicate that a value could be any type in a typesafe manner. Use `Any` to indicate that a value is dynamically typed.


## Nominal vs structural subtyping

Initially **PEP 484** defined the Python static type system as using *nominal subtyping*. This means that a class `A` is allowed where a class `B` is expected if and only if `A` is a subclass of `B`.

This requirement previously also applied to abstract base classes, such as `Iterable`. The problem with this approach is that a class had to be explicitly marked to support them, which is unpythonic and unlike what one would normally do in idiomatic dynamically typed Python code. For example, this conforms to **PEP 484**:

```python3
from collections.abc import Sized, Iterable, Iterator

class Bucket(Sized, Iterable[int]):
    ...
    def __len__(self) -> int: ...
    def __iter__(self) -> Iterator[int]: ...
```

**PEP 544** solves this problem by allowing users to write the above code without explicit base classes in the class definition, allowing `Bucket` to be implicitly considered a subtype of both `Sized` and `Iterable[int]` by static type checkers. This is known as *structural subtyping* (or static duck-typing):

```python3
from collections.abc import Iterator, Iterable

class Bucket:  # Note: no base classes
    ...
    def __len__(self) -> int: ...
    def __iter__(self) -> Iterator[int]: ...

def collect(items: Iterable[int]) -> int: ...
result = collect(Bucket())  # Passes type check
```

Moreover, by subclassing a special class `Protocol`, a user can define new custom protocols to fully enjoy structural subtyping (see examples below).
