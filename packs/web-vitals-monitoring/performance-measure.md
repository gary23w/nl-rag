# Performance: measure() method

Baseline

Widely available

This feature is well established and works across many devices and browser versions. It’s been available across browsers since September 2017.

- See full compatibility

**Note:** This feature is available in Web Workers.

The **`measure()`** method creates a named `PerformanceMeasure` object representing a time measurement between two marks in the browser's performance timeline.

When measuring between two marks, there is a *start mark* and *end mark*, respectively. The named timestamp is referred to as a *measure*.

## Syntax

```js
measure(measureName)
measure(measureName, startMark)
measure(measureName, startMark, endMark)
measure(measureName, measureOptions)
measure(measureName, measureOptions, endMark)
```

If only `measureName` is specified, the start timestamp is set to zero, and the end timestamp (which is used to calculate the duration) is the value that would be returned by `Performance.now()`.

You can use strings to identify `PerformanceMark` objects as start and end marks.

To only provide an `endMark`, you need to provide an empty `measureOptions` object: `performance.measure("myMeasure", {}, "myEndMarker")`.

### Parameters

**`measureName`**

A string representing the name of the measure.

**`measureOptions` Optional**

An object that may contain measure options.

**`detail` Optional**

Arbitrary metadata to be included in the measure. Defaults to `null`. Must be structured-cloneable.

**`devtools`**

Some browsers have use a structured `devtools` object within the `detail` object as part of an Extensibility API that surfaces these in custom tracks in performance traces. See the Chrome's Extensibility API documentation for more information.

**`dataType`**

String with a value of `track-entry` (for defining a new track) or `marker` (for defining an entry in a track).

**`color` Optional**

Defaults to `"primary"`. Must be one of `"primary"`, `"primary-light"`, `"primary-dark"`, `"secondary"`, `"secondary-light"`, `"secondary-dark"`, `"tertiary"`, `"tertiary-light"`, `"tertiary-dark"`, `"error"`.

**`track` Optional**

String of the name of the custom track (required for `track-entry`)

**`trackGroup` Optional**

String of the name of the grouping withing a custom track (required for `track-entry`)

**`properties` Optional**

Array of key-value pairs. Values can be any JSON-compatible type.

**`tooltipText` Optional**

Short description for tooltip.

**`start` Optional**

Timestamp (`DOMHighResTimeStamp`) to be used as the start time, or string that names a `PerformanceMark` to use for the start time.

If this is a string naming a `PerformanceMark`, then it is defined in the same way as `startMark`.

**`duration` Optional**

Duration (in milliseconds) between the start and end mark times. If omitted, this defaults to `performance.now()`; the time that has elapsed since the context was created. If provided, you must also specify either `start` or `end` but not both.

**`end` Optional**

Timestamp (`DOMHighResTimeStamp`) to be used as the end time, or string that names a `PerformanceMark` to use for the end time.

If this is a string naming a `PerformanceMark`, then it is defined in the same way as `endMark`.

**`startMark` Optional**

A string naming a `PerformanceMark` in the performance timeline. The `PerformanceEntry.startTime` property of this mark will be used for calculating the measure.

**`endMark` Optional**

A string naming a `PerformanceMark` in the performance timeline. The `PerformanceEntry.startTime` property of this mark will be used for calculating the measure. If you want to pass this argument, you must also pass either `startMark` or an empty `measureOptions` object.

### Return value

The `PerformanceMeasure` entry that was created.

The returned *measure* will have the following property values:

- `entryType` - set to `"measure"`.
- `name` - set to the `name` argument.
- `startTime` - set to:
  - a `timestamp`, if specified in `measureOptions.start`.
  - the `timestamp` of a start mark, if specified in `measureOptions.start` or `startMark`
  - a timestamp calculated from the `measureOptions.end` and `measureOptions.duration` (if `measureOptions.start` was not specified)
  - 0, if it isn't specified and can't be determined from other values.
- `duration` - set to a `DOMHighResTimeStamp` that is the duration of the measure calculated by subtracting the `startTime` from the end timestamp. The end timestamp is one of:
  - a `timestamp`, if specified in `measureOptions.end`.
  - the `timestamp` of an end mark, if one is specified in `measureOptions.end` or `endMark`
  - a timestamp calculated from the `measureOptions.start` and `measureOptions.duration` (if `measureOptions.end` was not specified)
  - the value returned by `Performance.now()`, if no end mark is specified or can be determined from other values.
- `detail` - set to the value passed in `measureOptions`.

### Exceptions

**`TypeError`**

This can be thrown in any case where the start, end or duration might be ambiguous:

- Both `endMark` and `measureOptions` are specified.
- `measureOptions` is specified with `duration` but without specifying either `start` or `end`.
- `measureOptions` is specified with all of `start`, `end`, and `duration`.

**`SyntaxError` `DOMException`**

The named mark does not exist.

- An end mark is specified using either `endMark` or `measureOptions.end`, but there is no `PerformanceMark` in the performance buffer with the matching name.
- An end mark is specified using either `endMark` or `measureOptions.end`, but it cannot be converted to match that of a read only attribute in the `PerformanceTiming` interface.
- A start mark is specified using either `startMark` or `measureOptions.start`, but there is no `PerformanceMark` in the performance buffer with the matching name.
- A start mark is specified using either `startMark` or `measureOptions.start`, but it cannot be converted to match that of a read only attribute in the `PerformanceTiming` interface.

**`DataCloneError` `DOMException`**

The `measureOptions.detail` value is non-`null` and cannot be serialized using the HTML "StructuredSerialize" algorithm.

**`RangeError`**

The `measureOptions.detail` value is non-`null` and memory cannot be allocated during serialization using the HTML "StructuredSerialize" algorithm.

## Examples

### Measuring duration between named markers

Given two of your own markers `"login-started"` and `"login-finished"`, you can create a measurement called `"login-duration"` as shown in the following example. The returned `PerformanceMeasure` object will then provide a `duration` property to tell you the elapsed time between the two markers.

```js
const loginMeasure = performance.measure(
  "login-duration",
  "login-started",
  "login-finished",
);
console.log(loginMeasure.duration);
```

### Measuring duration with custom start and end times

To do more advanced measurements, you can pass a `measureOptions` parameter. For example, you can use the `event.timeStamp` property from a `click` event as the start time.

```js
performance.measure("login-click", {
  start: myClickEvent.timeStamp,
  end: myMarker.startTime,
});
```

### Providing additional measurement details

You can use the `details` property to provide additional information of any type. Maybe you want to record which HTML element was clicked, for example.

```js
performance.measure("login-click", {
  detail: { htmlElement: myElement.id },
  start: myClickEvent.timeStamp,
  end: myMarker.startTime,
});
```

### DevTools Extensibility API

For browsers that support the Extensibility API you can use the `detail` parameter to provide more details in a `devtools` object that will be used to display this in performance profiles:

```js
const imageProcessingTimeStart = performance.now();

// ... later in your code

performance.measure("Image Processing Complete", {
  start: imageProcessingTimeStart,
  end: performance.now(),
  detail: {
    // This data appears in the "Summary"
    extraInfo: {
      imageId: "xyz-123",
      source: "cache",
      checkUrl: "https://example.com/check/xyz-123",
    },
    // The devtools object controls the track visualization
    devtools: {
      dataType: "track-entry",
      track: "Image Processing Tasks",
      trackGroup: "My Tracks",
      color: "tertiary-dark",
      properties: [
        ["Filter Type", "Gaussian Blur"],
        // Values can be objects, arrays, or other types
        ["Resize Dimensions", { w: 500, h: 300 }],
        // String values that are URLs get linkified
        ["Image URL", "https://example.com/img.png"],
      ],
      tooltipText: "Image processed successfully",
    },
  },
});
```
