# Autoconf

```
ash-0.3.8 $ case foo in esac;
error→Syntax error: ";" unexpected (expecting ")")
```

POSIX requires `case` to give an exit status of 0 if no cases match. However, `/bin/sh` in Solaris 10 does not obey this rule. Meanwhile, it is unclear whether a case that matches, but contains no statements, must also change the exit status to 0. The M4sh macro `AS_CASE` works around these inconsistencies.

```
$ bash -c 'case `false` in ?) ;; esac; echo $?'
0
$ /bin/sh -c 'case `false` in ?) ;; esac; echo $?'
255
```

**`cd`**

POSIX requires that `cd` must support the -L (“logical”) and -P (“physical”) options, with -L being the default. However, traditional shells do not support these options, and their `cd` command has the -P behavior.

Portable scripts should assume neither option is supported, and should assume neither behavior is the default. This can be a bit tricky, since the POSIX default behavior means that, for example, ‘ls ..’ and ‘cd ..’ may refer to different directories if the current logical directory is a symbolic link. It is safe to use `cd *dir*` if *dir* contains no .. components. Also, Autoconf-generated scripts check for this problem when computing variables like `ac_top_srcdir` (see Performing Configuration Actions), so it is safe to `cd` to these variables.

POSIX specifies an -e option that affects the exit status when the -P option is in effect. Portable scripts should avoid it for the same reason they avoid -P.

POSIX says that a successful `cd` updates the values of the `OLDPWD` and `PWD` variables, and that `cd -` acts like `cd "$OLDPWD"`. Older shells, such as Solaris 10 `/bin/sh`, do not support this and portable scripts should not rely on it.

If `HOME` is unset or empty, the behavior of `cd` with no arguments is implementation-defined, so portable scripts should avoid it in that case.

POSIX 1003.1-2024 states that `cd` must fail if given an explicit empty argument. However, earlier POSIX editions did not specify the behavior and some shells do nothing, some change to the first entry in `CDPATH`, some change to `HOME`, and some exit the shell rather than returning an error. Unfortunately, this means that if ‘$var’ is empty, then ‘cd "$var"’ is less predictable than ‘cd $var’ (at least the latter is well-behaved in all shells at changing to `HOME`, although this is probably not what you wanted in a script). You should check that a directory name was supplied before trying to change locations.

If `cd` fails, POSIX requires the invoking shell to behave as if `cd` exited with status 1, which means the invoking shell can continue. However, Solaris 10 `/bin/sh` aborts the containing command if interactive, and exits otherwise.

See Special Shell Variables, for portability problems involving `cd` and the `CDPATH` environment variable. Also please see the discussion of the `pwd` command.

**`echo`**

The simple `echo` is probably the most surprising source of portability troubles. It is not possible to use ‘echo’ portably unless both options and escape sequences are omitted.

Do not use options, as some shells support them and others do not. For example, POSIX says that the behavior of ‘echo -n foo’ is implementation-defined. On some platforms the output is ‘foo’ without a trailing newline, on others it is ‘-n foo’ with a trailing newline, and POSIX allows even other behavior.

Do not use backslashes in the arguments, as there is no consensus on their handling. For ‘echo '\n' | wc -l’, the `sh` of Solaris 10 outputs 2, but Bash and Zsh (in `sh` emulation mode) output 1. The problem is truly `echo`: all the shells understand ‘'\n'’ as the string composed of a backslash and an ‘n’.

Because of these problems, do not pass a string containing arbitrary characters to `echo`. For example, ‘echo "$foo"’ is safe only if you know that *foo*’s value cannot contain backslashes and cannot start with ‘-’.

Normally, `printf` is safer and easier to use than `echo` and `echo -n`. Thus, you should use `printf '%s\n'` instead of `echo`, and similarly use `printf %s` instead of `echo -n`.

Older scripts, written before `printf` was portable, sometimes used a here-document as a safer alternative to `echo`, like this:

```
cat <<EOF
$foo
EOF
```

However, this usage is problematic, as even some modern shells have hard-to-reproduce bugs when dealing with here-documents.

**`eval`**

The `eval` command is useful in limited circumstances, e.g., using commands like ‘eval table_$key=\$value’ and ‘eval value=table_$key’ to simulate a hash table when the key is known to be alphanumeric.

You should also be wary of common bugs in `eval` implementations. In some shell implementations (e.g., older `ash`, OpenBSD 3.8 `sh`, `pdksh` v5.2.14 99/07/13.2, and `zsh` 4.2.5), the arguments of ‘eval’ are evaluated in a context where ‘$?’ is 0, so they exhibit behavior like this:

```
$ false; eval 'echo $?'
0
```

The correct behavior here is to output a nonzero value, but portable scripts should not rely on this.

You should not rely on `LINENO` within `eval`. See Special Shell Variables.

Note that, even though these bugs are easily avoided, `eval` is tricky to use on arbitrary arguments. It is obviously unwise to use ‘eval $cmd’ if the string value of ‘cmd’ was derived from an untrustworthy source. But even if the string value is valid, ‘eval $cmd’ might not work as intended, since it causes field splitting and file name expansion to occur twice, once for the `eval` and once for the command itself. It is therefore safer to use ‘eval "$cmd"’. For example, if *cmd* has the value ‘cat test?.c’, ‘eval $cmd’ might expand to the equivalent of ‘cat test;.c’ if there happens to be a file named test;.c in the current directory; and this in turn mistakenly attempts to invoke `cat` on the file test and then execute the command `.c`. To avoid this problem, use ‘eval "$cmd"’ rather than ‘eval $cmd’.

However, suppose that you want to output the text of the evaluated command just before executing it. Assuming the previous example, ‘printf '%s\n' "Executing: $cmd"’ outputs ‘Executing: cat test?.c’, but this output doesn’t show the user that ‘test;.c’ is the actual name of the copied file. Conversely, ‘printf 'Executing:'; eval "printf ' %s' $cmd"; printf '\n'’ works on this example, but it fails with ‘cmd='cat foo >bar'’, since it mistakenly replaces the contents of bar by the string ‘ cat foo’. No simple, general, and portable solution to this problem is known.

**`exec`**

POSIX describes several categories of shell built-ins. Special built-ins (such as `exit`) must impact the environment of the current shell, and need not be available through `exec`. All other built-ins are regular, and must not propagate variable assignments to the environment of the current shell. However, the group of regular built-ins is further distinguished by commands that do not require a `PATH` search (such as `cd`), in contrast to built-ins that are offered as a more efficient version of something that must still be found in a `PATH` search (such as `echo`). POSIX is not clear on whether `exec` must work with the list of 17 utilities that are invoked without a `PATH` search, and many platforms lack an executable for some of those built-ins:

```
$ sh -c 'exec cd /tmp'
sh: line 0: exec: cd: not found
```

All other built-ins that provide utilities specified by POSIX must have a counterpart executable that exists on `PATH`, although POSIX allows `exec` to use the built-in instead of the executable. For example, contrast `bash` 3.2 and `pdksh` 5.2.14:

```
$ bash -c 'pwd --version' | head -n1
bash: line 0: pwd: --: invalid option
pwd: usage: pwd [-LP]
$ bash -c 'exec pwd --version' | head -n1
pwd (GNU coreutils) 6.10
$ pdksh -c 'exec pwd --version' | head -n1
pdksh: pwd: --: unknown option
```

When it is desired to avoid a regular shell built-in, the workaround is to use some other forwarding command, such as `env` or `nice`, that will ensure a path search:

```
$ pdksh -c 'exec true --version' | head -n1
$ pdksh -c 'nice true --version' | head -n1
true (GNU coreutils) 6.10
$ pdksh -c 'env true --version' | head -n1
true (GNU coreutils) 6.10
```

**`exit`**

The default value of `exit` is supposed to be `$?`; unfortunately, some shells, such as the DJGPP port of Bash 2.04, just perform ‘exit 0’.

```
bash-2.04$ foo=`exit 1` || echo fail
fail
bash-2.04$ foo=`(exit 1)` || echo fail
fail
bash-2.04$ foo=`(exit 1); exit` || echo fail
bash-2.04$
```

Using ‘exit $?’ restores the expected behavior.

Some shell scripts, such as those generated by `autoconf`, use a trap to clean up before exiting. If the last shell command exited with nonzero status, the trap also exits with nonzero status so that the invoker can tell that an error occurred.

Unfortunately, in some shells, such as Solaris 10 `/bin/sh`, an exit trap ignores the `exit` command’s argument. In these shells, a trap cannot determine whether it was invoked by plain `exit` or by `exit 1`. Instead of calling `exit` directly, use the `AC_MSG_ERROR` macro that has a workaround for this problem.

**`export`**

The builtin `export` dubs a shell variable *environment variable*. Each update of exported variables corresponds to an update of the environment variables. Conversely, each environment variable received by the shell when it is launched should be imported as a shell variable marked as exported.

Alas, some older shells, such as Solaris 10 `/bin/sh`, forget to `export` the environment variables they receive. As a result, two variables coexist: the environment variable and the shell variable. The following code demonstrates this failure:

```
#!/bin/sh
echo $FOO
FOO=bar
echo $FOO
exec /bin/sh $0
```

when run with ‘FOO=foo’ in the environment, these shells print alternately ‘foo’ and ‘bar’, although they should print only ‘foo’ and then a sequence of ‘bar’s.

Therefore you should `export` again each environment variable that you update; the export can occur before or after the assignment.

POSIX is not clear on whether the `export` of an undefined variable causes the variable to be defined with the value of an empty string, or merely marks any future definition of a variable by that name for export. Various shells behave differently in this regard:

```
$ sh -c 'export foo; env | grep foo'
$ ash -c 'export foo; env | grep foo'
foo=
```

POSIX requires `export` to honor assignments made as arguments, but older shells do not support this, including `/bin/sh` in Solaris 10. Portable scripts should separate assignments and exports into different statements.

```
$ bash -c 'export foo=bar; echo $foo'
bar
$ /bin/sh -c 'export foo=bar; echo $foo'
/bin/sh: foo=bar: is not an identifier
$ /bin/sh -c 'export foo; foo=bar; echo $foo'
bar
```

POSIX requires `export` to work with any arbitrary value for the contents of the variable being exported, as long as the total size of the environment combined with arguments doesn’t exceed `ARG_MAX` when executing a child process. However, some shells have extensions that involve interpreting some environment values specially, regardless of the variable name. We currently know of one case: all versions of Bash released prior to 27 September 2014 interpret an environment variable with an initial content substring of `() {` as an exported function definition (this is the “Shellshock” remote execution bug, CVE-2014-6271 and friends, where it was possible to exploit the function parser to cause remote code execution on child bash startup; newer versions of Bash use special environment variable *names* instead of values to implement the same feature).

There may be entries inherited into the environment that are not valid as shell variable names; POSIX states that processes should be tolerant of these names. Some shells such as `dash` do this by removing those names from the environment at startup, while others such as `bash` hide the entry from shell access but still pass it on to child processes. While you can set such names using `env` for a direct child process, you cannot rely on them being preserved through an intermediate pass through the shell.

**`false`**

Don’t expect `false` to exit with status 1: in native Solaris /bin/false exits with status 255.

**`for`**

To loop over positional arguments, use:

```
for arg
do
  printf '%s\n' "$arg"
done
```

You may *not* leave the `do` on the same line as `for`, since some shells improperly grok:

```
for arg; do
  printf '%s\n' "$arg"
done
```

If you want to explicitly refer to the positional arguments, use:

```
for arg in "$@"; do
  printf '%s\n' "$arg"
done
```

POSIX requires support for a `for` loop with no list after `in`. However, Solaris 10 `/bin/sh` treats that as a syntax error. It is possible to work around this by providing any shell word that expands to nothing, or by ignoring an obvious sentinel.

```
$ /bin/sh -c 'for a in $empty; do echo hi; done'
$ /bin/sh -c 'for a in ; do echo hi; done'
/bin/sh: syntax error at line 1: `;' unexpected
```

This syntax problem is most frequently encountered in code that goes through several layers of expansion, such as an m4 macro or makefile variable used as a list body, where the first layer of expansion (m4 or make) can end up expanding to nothing in the version handed to the shell. In the makefile context, one common workaround is to use a shell variable rather than a make variable as the source of the list.

```
$ cat Makefile
list =
bad:
	@for arg in $(list); do \
	  printf '%s\n' $$arg; \
	done
good:
	@list='$(list)'; \
	for arg in $$list; do \
	  printf '%s\n' $$arg; \
	done
$ make bad 2&>1 | head -n1
sh: syntax error at line 1: `;' unexpected
$ make bad list='a b'
a
b
$ make good
$ make good list='a b'
a
b
```

In Solaris 10 `/bin/sh`, when the list of arguments of a `for` loop starts with *unquoted* tokens looking like variable assignments, the loop is not executed on those tokens:

```
$ /bin/sh -c 'for v in a=b c=d x e=f; do echo $v; done'
x
e=f
```

Thankfully, quoting the assignment-like tokens, or starting the list with other tokens (including unquoted variable expansion that results in an assignment-like result), avoids the problem, so it is easy to work around:

```
$ /bin/sh -c 'for v in "a=b"; do echo $v; done'
a=b
$ /bin/sh -c 'x=a=b; for v in $x c=d; do echo $v; done'
a=b
c=d
```

**`if`**

If an `if` command is not inside `AC_DEFUN`, and it contains calls to Autoconf macros, it should be rewritten using `AS_IF`. See Common Shell Constructs.

Using `if ! …` is not portable. See `!` notes.

Some very old shells did not reset the exit status from an `if` with no `else`:

```
$ if (exit 42); then true; fi; echo $?
42
```

whereas a proper shell should have printed ‘0’. Although this is no longer a portability problem, as any shell that supports functions gets it correct, it explains why some makefiles have lengthy constructs:

```
if test -f "$file"; then
  install "$file" "$dest"
else
  :
fi
```

**`printf`**

A format string starting with a ‘-’ can cause problems. Bash interprets it as an option and gives an error. And ‘--’ to mark the end of options is not good in the NetBSD Almquist shell (e.g., 0.4.6) which takes that literally as the format string. Putting the ‘-’ in a ‘%c’ or ‘%s’ is probably easiest:

```
printf %s -foo
```

AIX 7.2 `sh` mishandles octal escapes in multi-byte locales by treating them as characters instead of bytes. For example, in a locale using the UTF-8 encoding, ‘printf '\351'’ outputs the two bytes C3, A9 (the UTF-8 encoding for U+00E9) instead of the desired single byte E9. To work around the bug, use the C locale.

Bash 2.03 mishandles an escape sequence that happens to evaluate to ‘%’:

```
$ printf '\045'
bash: printf: `%': missing format character
```

Large outputs may cause trouble. On Solaris 10, for example, /usr/bin/printf is buggy, so when using `/bin/sh` the command ‘printf %010000x 123’ normally dumps core.

Since `printf` is not always a shell builtin, there is a potential speed penalty for using `printf '%s\n'` as a replacement for an `echo` that does not interpret ‘\’ or leading ‘-’. With Solaris `ksh`, it is possible to use `print -r --` for this role instead.

See Limitations of Shell Builtins, for a discussion of portable alternatives to both `printf` and `echo`.

**`pwd`**

With modern shells, plain `pwd` outputs a “logical” directory name, some of whose components may be symbolic links. These directory names are in contrast to “physical” directory names, whose components are all directories.

POSIX requires that `pwd` must support the -L (“logical”) and -P (“physical”) options, with -L being the default. However, traditional shells do not support these options, and their `pwd` command has the -P behavior.

Portable scripts should assume neither option is supported, and should assume neither behavior is the default. Also, on many hosts ‘/bin/pwd’ is equivalent to ‘pwd -P’, but POSIX does not require this behavior and portable scripts should not rely on it.

Typically it’s best to use plain `pwd`. On modern hosts this outputs logical directory names, which have the following advantages:

- Logical names are what the user specified.
- Physical names may not be portable from one installation host to another due to network file system gymnastics.
- On modern hosts ‘pwd -P’ may fail due to lack of permissions to some parent directory, but plain `pwd` cannot fail for this reason.

Also please see the discussion of the `cd` command.

**`read`**

No options are portable, not even support -r (Solaris 10 `/bin/sh` for example).

**`set`**

With the FreeBSD 6.0 shell, the `set` command (without any options) does not sort its output.

The `set` builtin faces the usual problem with arguments starting with a dash. Modern shells understand -- to specify the end of the options (any argument after -- is a parameter, even ‘-x’ for instance), but some ancient shells stop option processing only after a non-option argument is found. Therefore, use ‘dummy’ or simply ‘x’ to end the option processing, and use `shift` to pop it out:

```
set x $my_list; shift
```

Avoid ‘set -’, e.g., ‘set - $my_list’. POSIX no longer requires support for this command, and in traditional shells ‘set - $my_list’ resets the -v and -x options, which makes scripts harder to debug.

Some nonstandard shells do not recognize more than one option (e.g., ‘set -e -x’ assigns ‘-x’ to the command line). It is better to combine them:

```
set -ex
```

The -e option has historically been under-specified, with enough ambiguities to cause numerous differences across various shell implementations; see for example this overview, or this link, documenting a change to POSIX 2008 to match `ksh88` behavior. Note that mixing `set -e` and shell functions is asking for surprises:

```
set -e
doit()
{
  rm file
  echo one
}
doit || echo two
```

According to the recommendation, ‘one’ should always be output regardless of whether the `rm` failed, because it occurs within the body of the shell function ‘doit’ invoked on the left side of ‘||’, where the effects of ‘set -e’ are not enforced. Likewise, ‘two’ should never be printed, since the failure of `rm` does not abort the function, such that the status of ‘doit’ is 0.

The BSD shell has had several problems with the -e option. Older versions of the BSD shell (circa 1990) mishandled ‘&&’, ‘||’, ‘if’, and ‘case’ when -e was in effect, causing the shell to exit unexpectedly in some cases. This was particularly a problem with makefiles, and led to circumlocutions like ‘sh -c 'test -f file || touch file'’, where the seemingly-unnecessary ‘sh -c '…'’ wrapper works around the bug (see Failure in Make Rules).

Even relatively-recent versions of the BSD shell (e.g., OpenBSD 3.4) wrongly exit with -e if the last command within a compound statement fails and is guarded by an ‘&&’ only. For example:

```
#! /bin/sh
set -e
foo=''
test -n "$foo" && exit 1
echo one
if :; then
  test -n "$foo" && exit 1
  echo two
  test -n "$foo" && exit 1
fi
echo three
```

does not print ‘three’. One workaround is to change the last instance of ‘test -n "$foo" && exit 1’ to be ‘if test -n "$foo"; then exit 1; fi’ instead. Another possibility is to warn BSD users not to use ‘sh -e’.

When ‘set -e’ is in effect, a failed command substitution in Solaris 10 `/bin/sh` cannot be ignored, even with ‘||’.

```
$ /bin/sh -c 'set -e; foo=`false` || echo foo; echo bar'
$ bash -c 'set -e; foo=`false` || echo foo; echo bar'
foo
bar
```

Moreover, a command substitution, successful or not, causes this shell to exit from a failing outer command even in presence of an ‘&&’ list:

```
$ bash -c 'set -e; false `true` && echo notreached; echo ok'
ok
$ sh -c 'set -e; false `true` && echo notreached; echo ok'
$
```

Job control is not provided by all shells, so the use of ‘set -m’ or ‘set -b’ must be done with care. When using `zsh` in native mode, asynchronous notification (‘set -b’) is enabled by default, and using ‘emulate sh’ to switch to POSIX mode does not clear this setting (although asynchronous notification has no impact unless job monitoring is also enabled). Also, `zsh` 4.3.10 and earlier have a bug where job control can be manipulated in interactive shells, but not in subshells or scripts. Furthermore, some shells, like `pdksh`, fail to treat subshells as interactive, even though the parent shell was.

```
$ echo $ZSH_VERSION
4.3.10
$ set -m; echo $?
0
$ zsh -c 'set -m; echo $?'
set: can't change option: -m
$ (set -m); echo $?
set: can't change option: -m
1
$ pdksh -ci 'echo $-; (echo $-)'
cim
c
```

Use of `set -n` (typically via `sh -n script`) to validate a script is not foolproof. Modern `ksh93` tries to be helpful by informing you about better syntax, but switching the script to use the suggested syntax in order to silence the warnings would render the script no longer portable to older shells:

```
$ ksh -nc '``'
ksh: warning: line 1: `...` obsolete, use $(...)
0
```

Autoconf itself uses `sh -n` within its testsuite to check that correct scripts were generated, but only after first probing for other shell features (such as `test ${BASH_VERSION+y}`) that indicate a reasonably fast and working implementation.

**`shift`**

Not only is `shift`ing a bad idea when there is nothing left to shift, but in addition it is not portable: the shell of MIPS RISC/OS 4.52 refuses to do it.

Don’t use ‘shift 2’ etc.; while it in the SVR1 shell (1983), it is also absent in many pre-POSIX shells.

**`source`**

This command is not portable, as POSIX does not require it; use `.` instead.

**`test`**

The `test` program is the way to perform many file and string tests. It is often invoked by the alternate name ‘[’, but using that name in Autoconf code is asking for trouble since it is an M4 quote character.

The -a, -o, ‘(’, and ‘)’ operands are not present in all implementations, and have been marked obsolete by POSIX 2008. This is because there are inherent ambiguities in using them. For example, ‘test "$1" -a "$2"’ looks like a binary operator to check whether two strings are both non-empty, but if ‘$1’ is the literal ‘!’, then some implementations of `test` treat it as a negation of the unary operator -a.

Thus, portable uses of `test` should never have more than four arguments, and scripts should use shell constructs like ‘&&’ and ‘||’ instead. If you combine ‘&&’ and ‘||’ in the same statement, keep in mind that they have equal precedence, so it is often better to parenthesize even when this is redundant. For example:

```
# Not portable:
test "X$a" = "X$b" -a \
  '(' "X$c" != "X$d" -o "X$e" = "X$f" ')'

# Portable:
test "X$a" = "X$b" &&
  { test "X$c" != "X$d" || test "X$e" = "X$f"; }
```

`test` does not process options like most other commands do; for example, it does not recognize the -- argument as marking the end of options.

It is safe to use ‘!’ as a `test` operator. For example, ‘if test ! -d foo; …’ is portable even though ‘if ! test -d foo; …’ is not.

**`test` (files)**

To enable `configure` scripts to support cross-compilation, they shouldn’t do anything that tests features of the build system instead of the host system. But occasionally you may find it necessary to check whether some arbitrary file exists. To do so, use ‘test -f’, ‘test -r’, or ‘test -x’. Do not use ‘test -e’, because Solaris 10 `/bin/sh` lacks it.

To test for symbolic links on systems that have them, use ‘test -h’ rather than ‘test -L’; either form conforms to POSIX, but -h has been around longer.

The commands ‘test A -ot B’ and ‘test A -nt B’ are not reliable on macOS `sh` through at least macOS Sequoia 15.1.1 (2024), where ‘test’ ignores the subsecond part of file timestamps. To work around this bug, arrange for the timestamps to be at least one second apart.

For historical reasons, POSIX reluctantly allows implementations of ‘test -x’ that will succeed for the root user, even if no execute permissions are present. Furthermore, shells do not all agree on whether Access Control Lists should affect ‘test -r’, ‘test -w’, and ‘test -x’; some shells base test results strictly on the current user id compared to file owner and mode, as if by `stat(2)`; while other shells base test results on whether the current user has the given right, even if that right is only granted by an ACL, as if by `faccessat(2)`. Furthermore, there is a classic time of check to time of use race between any use of `test` followed by operating on the just-checked file. Therefore, it is a good idea to write scripts that actually attempt an operation, and are prepared for the resulting failure if permission is denied, rather than trying to avoid an operation based solely on whether `test` guessed that it might not be permitted.

**`test` (strings)**

POSIX says that ‘test "*string*"’ succeeds if *string* is not null, but this usage is not portable to traditional platforms like Solaris 10 `/bin/sh`, which mishandle strings like ‘!’ and ‘-n’. However, it *is* portable to test if a variable is set to a non-empty value, by using ‘test ${var+y}’, since all known implementations properly distinguish between no arguments and a known-safe string of ‘y’.

POSIX also says that ‘test ! "*string*"’, ‘test -n "*string*"’ and ‘test -z "*string*"’ work with any string, but some shells (such as Solaris 10) get confused if *string* looks like an operator:

```
$ test -n =
test: argument expected
$ test ! -n
test: argument expected
$ test -z ")"; echo $?
0
```

Similarly, POSIX says that both ‘test "*string1*" = "*string2"*’ and ‘test "*string1*" != "*string2"*’ work for any pairs of strings, but in practice this is not true for troublesome strings that look like operators or parentheses, or that begin with ‘-’.

It is best to protect such strings with a leading ‘X’, e.g., ‘test "X*string*" != X’ rather than ‘test -n "*string*"’ or ‘test ! "*string*"’.

It is common to find variations of the following idiom:

```
test -n "`echo $ac_feature | sed 's/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]//g'`" &&
  action
```

to take an action when a token matches a given pattern. Such constructs should be avoided by using:

```
AS_CASE([$ac_feature],
  [[*[!-a-zA-Z0-9_]*]], [action])
```

If the pattern is a complicated regular expression that cannot be expressed as a shell pattern, use something like this instead:

```
expr "X$ac_feature" : 'X.*[^-a-zA-Z0-9_]' >/dev/null &&
  action
```

‘expr "X*foo*" : "X*bar*"’ is more robust than ‘echo "X*foo*" | grep "^X*bar*"’, because it avoids problems when ‘*foo*’ contains backslashes.

**`trap`**

It is safe to trap at least the signals 1, 2, 13, and 15. You can also trap 0, i.e., have the `trap` run when the script ends (either via an explicit `exit`, or the end of the script). The trap for 0 should be installed outside of a shell function, or AIX 7.3 `/bin/sh` will invoke the trap at the end of this function.

POSIX says that ‘trap - 1 2 13 15’ resets the traps for the specified signals to their default values, but many common shells (e.g., Solaris 10 `/bin/sh`) misinterpret this and attempt to execute a “command” named `-` when the specified conditions arise. POSIX 2008 also added a requirement to support ‘trap 1 2 13 15’ to reset traps, as this is supported by a larger set of shells, but there are still shells like `dash` that mistakenly try to execute `1` instead of resetting the traps. Therefore, there is no portable workaround, except for ‘trap - 0’, for which ‘trap '' 0’ is a portable substitute.

Although POSIX is not absolutely clear on this point, it is widely admitted that when entering the trap ‘$?’ should be set to the exit status of the last command run before the trap. The ambiguity can be summarized as: “when the trap is launched by an `exit`, what is the *last* command run: that before `exit`, or `exit` itself?”

Bash considers `exit` to be the last command, while Zsh and Solaris 10 `/bin/sh` consider that when the trap is run it is *still* in the `exit`, hence it is the previous exit status that the trap receives:

```
$ cat trap.sh
trap 'echo $?' 0
(exit 42); exit 0
$ zsh trap.sh
42
$ bash trap.sh
0
```

The portable solution is then simple: when you want to ‘exit 42’, run ‘(exit 42); exit 42’, the first `exit` being used to set the exit status to 42 for Zsh, and the second to trigger the trap and pass 42 as exit status for Bash. In M4sh, this is covered by using `AS_EXIT`.

The shell in FreeBSD 4.0 has the following bug: ‘$?’ is reset to 0 by empty lines if the code is inside `trap`.

```
$ trap 'false

echo $?' 0
$ exit
0
```

Fortunately, this bug only affects `trap`.

Several shells fail to execute an exit trap that is defined inside a subshell, when the last command of that subshell is not a builtin. A workaround is to use ‘exit $?’ as the shell builtin.

```
$ bash -c '(trap "echo hi" 0; /bin/true)'
hi
$ /bin/sh -c '(trap "echo hi" 0; /bin/true)'
$ /bin/sh -c '(trap "echo hi" 0; /bin/true; exit $?)'
hi
```

Likewise, older implementations of `bash` failed to preserve ‘$?’ across an exit trap consisting of a single cleanup command.

```
$ bash -c 'trap "/bin/true" 0; exit 2'; echo $?
2
$ bash-2.05b -c 'trap "/bin/true" 0; exit 2'; echo $?
0
$ bash-2.05b -c 'trap ":; /bin/true" 0; exit 2'; echo $?
2
```

Be aware that a trap can be called from any number of places in your script, and therefore the trap handler should not make assumptions about shell state. For some examples, if your script temporarily modifies `IFS`, then the trap should include an initialization back to its typical value of space-tab-newline (autoconf does this for generated configure files). Likewise, if your script changes the current working directory at some point after the trap is installed, then your trap cannot assume which directory it is in, and should begin by changing directories to an absolute path if that is important to the cleanup efforts (autotest does this for generated testsuite files).

**`true`**

Don’t worry: as far as we know `true` is portable. Nevertheless, it’s not always a builtin (e.g., Bash 1.x), and the portable shell community tends to prefer using `:`. This has a funny side effect: when asked whether `false` is more portable than `true` Alexandre Oliva answered:

> In a sense, yes, because if it doesn’t exist, the shell will produce an exit status of failure, which is correct for `false`, but not for `true`.

Remember that even though ‘:’ ignores its arguments, it still takes time to compute those arguments. It is a good idea to use double quotes around any arguments to ‘:’ to avoid time spent in field splitting and file name expansion.

**`unset`**

In some nonconforming shells (e.g., Solaris 10 `/bin/ksh` and `/usr/xpg4/bin/sh`, NetBSD 5.99.43 sh, or Bash 2.05a), `unset FOO` fails when `FOO` is not set. This can interfere with `set -e` operation. You can use

```
FOO=; unset FOO
```

if you are not sure that `FOO` is set.

A few ancient shells lack `unset` entirely. For some variables such as `PS1`, you can use a neutralizing value instead:

```
PS1='$ '
```

Usually, shells that do not support `unset` need less effort to make the environment sane, so for example is not a problem if you cannot unset `CDPATH` on those shells. However, Bash 2.01 mishandles `unset MAIL` and `unset MAILPATH` in some cases and dumps core. So, you should do something like

```
( (unset MAIL) || exit 1) >/dev/null 2>&1 && unset MAIL || :
```

See Special Shell Variables, for some neutralizing values. Also, see Limitations of Builtins, for the case of environment variables.

**`wait`**

The exit status of `wait` is not always reliable.

### 11.15 Limitations of Usual Tools

The small set of tools you can expect to find on any machine can still include some limitations you should be aware of.

**`awk`**

Don’t leave white space before the opening parenthesis in a user function call. POSIX does not allow this and GNU Awk rejects it:

```
$ gawk 'function die () { print "Aaaaarg!"  }
        BEGIN { die () }'
gawk: cmd. line:2:         BEGIN { die () }
gawk: cmd. line:2:                      ^ parse error
$ gawk 'function die () { print "Aaaaarg!"  }
        BEGIN { die() }'
Aaaaarg!
```

POSIX says that if a program contains only ‘BEGIN’ actions, and contains no instances of `getline`, then the program merely executes the actions without reading input. However, traditional Awk implementations (such as Solaris 10 `awk`) read and discard input in this case. Portable scripts can redirect input from /dev/null to work around the problem. For example:

```
awk 'BEGIN {print "hello world"}' </dev/null
```

POSIX says that in an ‘END’ action, ‘$NF’ (and presumably, ‘$1’) retain their value from the last record read, if no intervening ‘getline’ occurred. However, some implementations (such as Solaris 10 ‘/usr/bin/awk’, ‘nawk’, or Darwin ‘awk’) reset these variables. A workaround is to use an intermediate variable prior to the ‘END’ block. For example:

```
$ cat end.awk
{ tmp = $1 }
END { print "a", $1, $NF, "b", tmp }
$ echo 1 | awk -f end.awk
a   b 1
$ echo 1 | gawk -f end.awk
a 1 1 b 1
```

If you want your program to be deterministic, don’t depend on `for` on arrays:

```
$ cat for.awk
END {
  arr["foo"] = 1
  arr["bar"] = 1
  for (i in arr)
    print i
}
$ gawk -f for.awk </dev/null
foo
bar
$ nawk -f for.awk </dev/null
bar
foo
```

Some Awk implementations, such as HP-UX 11.0’s native one, mishandle anchors:

```
$ echo xfoo | $AWK '/foo|^bar/ { print }'
$ echo bar | $AWK '/foo|^bar/ { print }'
bar
$ echo xfoo | $AWK '/^bar|foo/ { print }'
xfoo
$ echo bar | $AWK '/^bar|foo/ { print }'
bar
```

Either do not depend on such patterns (i.e., use ‘/^(.*foo|bar)/’, or use a simple test to reject such implementations.

On ‘ia64-hp-hpux11.23’, Awk mishandles `printf` conversions after `%u`:

```
$ awk 'BEGIN { printf "%u %d\n", 0, -1 }'
0 0
```

AIX version 5.2 has an arbitrary limit of 399 on the length of regular expressions and literal strings in an Awk program.

Traditional Awk implementations derived from Unix version 7, such as Solaris `/bin/awk`, have many limitations and do not conform to POSIX. Nowadays `AC_PROG_AWK` (see Particular Program Checks) finds you an Awk that doesn’t have these problems, but if for some reason you prefer not to use `AC_PROG_AWK` you may need to address them. For more detailed descriptions, see `awk` language history in *GNU Awk User’s Guide*.

Traditional Awk does not support multidimensional arrays or user-defined functions.

Traditional Awk does not support the -v option. You can use assignments after the program instead, e.g., `$AWK '{print v $1}' v=x`; however, don’t forget that such assignments are not evaluated until they are encountered (e.g., after any `BEGIN` action).

Traditional Awk does not support the keywords `delete` or `do`.

Traditional Awk does not support the expressions `*a*?*b*:*c*`, `!*a*`, `*a*^*b*`, or `*a*^=*b*`.

Traditional Awk does not support the predefined `CONVFMT` or `ENVIRON` variables.

Traditional Awk supports only the predefined functions `exp`, `index`, `int`, `length`, `log`, `split`, `sprintf`, `sqrt`, and `substr`.

Traditional Awk `getline` is not at all compatible with POSIX; avoid it.

Traditional Awk has `for (i in a) …` but no other uses of the `in` keyword. For example, it lacks `if (i in a) …`.

In code portable to both traditional and modern Awk, `FS` must be a string containing just one ordinary character, and similarly for the field-separator argument to `split`.

Traditional Awk has a limit of 99 fields in a record and splits the input even if you don’t refer to any field in the script. To circumvent this problem, set ‘FS’ to an unusual character and use `split`.

Traditional Awk has a limit of at most 99 bytes in a number formatted by `OFMT`; for example, `OFMT="%.300e"; print 0.1;` typically dumps core.

The original version of Awk had a limit of at most 99 bytes per `split` field, 99 bytes per `substr` substring, and 99 bytes per run of non-special characters in a `printf` format, but these bugs have been fixed on all practical hosts that we know of.

HP-UX 11.00 Awk requires that input files have a line length of at most 3070 bytes.
