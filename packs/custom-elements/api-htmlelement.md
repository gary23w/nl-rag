The **`HTMLElement`** interface represents any HTML element. Some elements directly implement this interface, while others implement it via an interface that inherits it.

## Instance properties

*Also inherits properties from its parent, `Element`.*

**`HTMLElement.accessKey`**

A string representing the access key assigned to the element.

**`HTMLElement.accessKeyLabel` Read only**

Returns a string containing the element's assigned access key.

**`HTMLElement.anchorElement` Read only**

Returns a reference to the element's anchor element, or `null` if it doesn't have one.

**`HTMLElement.attributeStyleMap` Read only**

A `StylePropertyMap` representing the declarations of the element's `style` attribute.

**`HTMLElement.autocapitalize`**

A string that represents the element's capitalization behavior for user input. Valid values are: `none`, `off`, `on`, `characters`, `words`, `sentences`.

**`HTMLElement.autofocus`**

A boolean value reflecting the `autofocus` HTML global attribute, which indicates whether the control should be focused when the page loads, or when dialog or popover become shown if specified in an element inside `<dialog>` elements or elements whose popover attribute is set.

**`HTMLElement.autocorrect`**

A boolean that represents whether or not text input by a user should be automatically corrected. This reflects the `autocorrect` HTML global attribute.

**`HTMLElement.contentEditable`**

A string, where a value of `true` means the element is editable and a value of `false` means it isn't.

**`HTMLElement.dataset` Read only**

Returns a `DOMStringMap` with which script can read and write the element's custom data attributes (`data-*`).

**`HTMLElement.dir`**

A string, reflecting the `dir` global attribute, representing the directionality of the element. Possible values are `"ltr"`, `"rtl"`, and `"auto"`.

**`HTMLElement.draggable`**

A boolean value indicating if the element can be dragged.

**`HTMLElement.editContext`**

Returns the `EditContext` associated with the element, or `null` if there isn't one.

**`HTMLElement.enterKeyHint`**

A string defining what action label (or icon) to present for the enter key on virtual keyboards.

**`HTMLElement.hidden`**

A string or boolean value reflecting the value of the element's `hidden` attribute.

**`HTMLElement.inert`**

A boolean value indicating whether the user agent must act as though the given node is absent for the purposes of user interaction events, in-page text searches ("find in page"), and text selection.

**`HTMLElement.innerText`**

Represents the rendered text content of a node and its descendants. As a getter, it approximates the text the user would get if they highlighted the contents of the element with the cursor and then copied it to the clipboard. As a setter, it replaces the content inside the selected element, converting any line breaks into `<br>` elements.

**`HTMLElement.inputMode`**

A string value reflecting the value of the element's `inputmode` attribute.

**`HTMLElement.isContentEditable` Read only**

Returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the content of the element can be edited.

**`HTMLElement.lang`**

A string representing the language of an element's attributes, text, and element contents.

**`HTMLElement.nonce`**

Returns the cryptographic number used once that is used by Content Security Policy to determine whether a given fetch will be allowed to proceed.

**`HTMLElement.offsetHeight` Read only**

Returns a `double` containing the height of an element, relative to the layout.

**`HTMLElement.offsetLeft` Read only**

Returns a `double`, the distance from this element's left border to its `offsetParent`'s left border.

**`HTMLElement.offsetParent` Read only**

An `Element` that is the element from which all offset calculations are currently computed.

**`HTMLElement.offsetTop` Read only**

Returns a `double`, the distance from this element's top border to its `offsetParent`'s top border.

**`HTMLElement.offsetWidth` Read only**

Returns a `double` containing the width of an element, relative to the layout.

**`HTMLElement.outerText`**

Represents the rendered text content of a node and its descendants. As a getter, it is the same as `HTMLElement.innerText` (it represents the rendered text content of an element and its descendants). As a setter, it replaces the selected node and its contents with the given value, converting any line breaks into `<br>` elements.

**`HTMLElement.popover`**

Gets and sets an element's popover state via JavaScript (`"auto"`, `"hint"`, or `"manual"`), and can be used for feature detection. Reflects the value of the `popover` global HTML attribute.

**`HTMLElement.spellcheck`**

A boolean value that controls the spell-checking hint. It is available on all HTML elements, though it doesn't affect all of them.

**`HTMLElement.style`**

A `CSSStyleDeclaration` representing the declarations of the element's `style` attribute.

**`HTMLElement.tabIndex`**

A `long` representing the position of the element in the tabbing order.

**`HTMLElement.title`**

A string containing the text that appears in a popup box when mouse is over the element.

**`HTMLElement.translate`**

A boolean value representing the translation.

**`HTMLElement.virtualKeyboardPolicy`**

A string indicating the on-screen virtual keyboard behavior on devices such as tablets, mobile phones, or other devices where a hardware keyboard may not be available, if the element's content is editable (for example, it is an `<input>` or `<textarea>` element, or an element with the `contenteditable` attribute set).

**`HTMLElement.writingSuggestions`**

A string indicating if browser-provided writing suggestions should be enabled under the scope of the element or not.

## Instance methods

*Also inherits methods from its parent, `Element`.*

**`HTMLElement.attachInternals()`**

Returns an `ElementInternals` object, and enables a custom element to participate in HTML forms.

**`HTMLElement.blur()`**

Removes keyboard focus from the currently focused element.

**`HTMLElement.click()`**

Sends a mouse click event to the element.

**`HTMLElement.focus()`**

Makes the element the current keyboard focus.

**`HTMLElement.hidePopover()`**

Hides a popover element by removing it from the top layer and styling it with `display: none`.

**`HTMLElement.showPopover()`**

Shows a popover element by adding it to the top layer and removing `display: none;` from its styles.

**`HTMLElement.togglePopover()`**

Toggles a popover element between the hidden and showing states.

## Events

Listen to these events using `addEventListener()` or by assigning an event listener to the `oneventname` property of this interface.

*Also, inherits events from its parent, `Element`.*

**`change`**

Fired when the `value` of an `<input>`, `<select>`, or `<textarea>` element has been changed and committed by the user. Unlike the `input` event, the `change` event is not necessarily fired for each alteration to an element's `value`.

**`command`**

Fires on an element that is controlled via a `button` with valid `commandForElement` and `command` values, whenever the button is interacted with (e.g., it is clicked).

**`error`**

Fired when a resource failed to load, or can't be used.

**`load`**

Fires for elements containing a resource when the resource has successfully loaded.

### Drag & drop events

**`drag`**

This event is fired when an element or text selection is being dragged.

**`dragend`**

This event is fired when a drag operation is being ended (by releasing a mouse button or hitting the escape key).

**`dragenter`**

This event is fired when a dragged element or text selection enters a valid drop target.

**`dragleave`**

This event is fired when a dragged element or text selection leaves a valid drop target.

**`dragover`**

This event is fired continuously when an element or text selection is being dragged and the mouse pointer is over a valid drop target (every 50 ms WHEN mouse is not moving ELSE much faster between 5 ms (slow movement) and 1ms (fast movement) approximately. This firing pattern is different than `mouseover` ).

**`dragstart`**

This event is fired when the user starts dragging an element or text selection.

**`drop`**

This event is fired when an element or text selection is dropped on a valid drop target.

### Interest invoker events

**`interest`**

Fired on the target element of an interest invoker when interest is shown, allowing code to be run in response.

**`loseinterest`**

Fired on the target element of an interest invoker when interest is lost, allowing code to be run in response.

### Toggle events

**`beforetoggle`**

Fired when the element is a popover or `<dialog>`, before it is hidden or shown.

**`toggle`**

Fired when the element is a popover, `<dialog>`, or `<details>` element, just after it is hidden or shown.
