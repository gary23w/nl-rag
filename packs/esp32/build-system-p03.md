## Build System Internals

### Build Scripts

The listfiles for the ESP-IDF build system reside in /tools/cmake. The modules which implement core build system functionality are as follows:

> > - build.cmake - Build related commands i.e., build initialization, retrieving/setting build properties, build processing.
> > - component.cmake - Component related commands i.e., adding components, retrieving/setting component properties, registering components.
> > - kconfig.cmake - Generation of configuration files (sdkconfig, sdkconfig.h, sdkconfig.cmake, etc.) from Kconfig files.
> > - ldgen.cmake - Generation of final linker script from linker fragment files.
> > - target.cmake - Setting build target and toolchain file.
> > - utilities.cmake - Miscellaneous helper commands.
> 
> Aside from these files, there are two other important CMake scripts in /tools/cmake:
> 
> > - idf.cmake - Sets up the build and includes the core modules listed above. Included in CMake projects in order to access ESP-IDF build system functionality.
> > - project.cmake - Includes `idf.cmake` and provides a custom `project()` command that takes care of all the heavy lifting of building an executable. Included in the top-level CMakeLists.txt of standard ESP-IDF projects.

The rest of the files in /tools/cmake are support or third-party scripts used in the build process.

### Build Process

This section describes the standard ESP-IDF application build process. The build process can be broken down roughly into four phases:

#### Initialization

This phase sets up necessary parameters for the build.

> > - Upon inclusion of `idf.cmake` in `project.cmake`, the following steps are performed: Set `IDF_PATH` from environment variable or inferred from path to `project.cmake` included in the top-level CMakeLists.txt. Add /tools/cmake to `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH` and include core modules plus the various helper/third-party scripts. Set build tools/executables such as default Python interpreter. Get ESP-IDF git revision and store as `IDF_VER`. Set global build specifications i.e., compile options, compile definitions, include directories for all components in the build. Add components in components to the build.
> > - The initial part of the custom `project()` command performs the following steps: Set `IDF_TARGET` from environment variable or CMake cache and the corresponding `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` to be used. Add components in `EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS` to the build. Prepare arguments for calling command `idf_build_process()` from variables such as `COMPONENTS`/`EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS`, `SDKCONFIG`, `SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS`.
> 
> The call to `idf_build_process()` command marks the end of this phase.

#### Enumeration

> This phase builds a final list of components to be processed in the build, and is performed in the first half of `idf_build_process()`.
> 
> > - Retrieve each component's public and private requirements. A child process is created which executes each component's CMakeLists.txt in script mode. The values of `idf_component_register` REQUIRES and PRIV_REQUIRES argument is returned to the parent build process. This is called early expansion. The variable `CMAKE_BUILD_EARLY_EXPANSION` is defined during this step.
> > - Recursively include components based on public and private requirements.
> > - Unless IDF Component Manager is disabled, it is called to resolve the dependencies of the components: - Looks for manifests and dependencies contained in the project. - Starts the version solving process to resolve the dependencies of the components. - When the version solving process succeeds, the IDF Component Manager downloads dependencies, integrates them into the build, and creates a `dependencies.lock` file that contains a list of the exact versions of the dependencies installed by the IDF Component Manager.

#### Processing

> This phase processes the components in the build, and is the second half of `idf_build_process()`.
> 
> - Load project configuration from sdkconfig file and generate an sdkconfig.cmake and sdkconfig.h header. These define configuration variables/macros that are accessible from the build scripts and C/C++ source/header files, respectively.
> - Include each component's `project_include.cmake`.
> - Add each component as a subdirectory, processing its CMakeLists.txt. The component CMakeLists.txt calls the registration command, `idf_component_register` which adds source files, include directories, creates component library, links dependencies, etc.

#### Finalization

> This phase is everything after `idf_build_process()`.
> 
> - Create executable and link the component libraries to it.
> - Generate project metadata files such as project_description.json and display relevant information about the project built.

## Migrating from ESP-IDF GNU Make System

Some aspects of the CMake-based ESP-IDF build system are very similar to the older GNU Make-based system. The developer needs to provide values the include directories, source files etc. There is a syntactical difference, however, as the developer needs to pass these as arguments to the registration command, `idf_component_register`.

### Automatic Conversion Tool

An automatic project conversion tool is available in *tools/cmake/convert_to_cmake.py* in ESP-IDF v4.x releases. The script was removed in v5.0 because of its *make* build system dependency.

### No Longer Available in CMake

Some features are significantly different or removed in the CMake-based system. The following variables no longer exist in the CMake-based build system:

- `COMPONENT_BUILD_DIR`: Use `CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` instead.
- `COMPONENT_LIBRARY`: Defaulted to `$(COMPONENT_NAME).a`, but the library name could be overridden by the component. The name of the component library can no longer be overridden by the component.
- `CC`, `LD`, `AR`, `OBJCOPY`: Full paths to each tool from the gcc xtensa cross-toolchain. Use `CMAKE_C_COMPILER`, `CMAKE_C_LINK_EXECUTABLE`, `CMAKE_OBJCOPY`, etc instead. Full list here.
- `HOSTCC`, `HOSTLD`, `HOSTAR`: Full names of each tool from the host native toolchain. These are no longer provided, external projects should detect any required host toolchain manually.
- `COMPONENT_ADD_LDFLAGS`: Used to override linker flags. Use the CMake target_link_libraries command instead.
- `COMPONENT_ADD_LINKER_DEPS`: List of files that linking should depend on. target_link_libraries will usually infer these dependencies automatically. For linker scripts, use the provided custom CMake function `target_linker_scripts`.
- `COMPONENT_SUBMODULES`: No longer used, the build system will automatically enumerate all submodules in the ESP-IDF repository.
- `COMPONENT_EXTRA_INCLUDES`: Used to be an alternative to `COMPONENT_PRIV_INCLUDEDIRS` for absolute paths. Use `PRIV_INCLUDE_DIRS` argument to `idf_component_register` for all cases now (can be relative or absolute).
- `COMPONENT_OBJS`: Previously, component sources could be specified as a list of object files. Now they can be specified as a list of source files via `SRCS` argument to *idf_component_register*.
- `COMPONENT_OBJEXCLUDE`: Has been replaced with `EXCLUDE_SRCS` argument to `idf_component_register`. Specify source files (as absolute paths or relative to component directory), instead.
- `COMPONENT_EXTRA_CLEAN`: Set property `ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES` instead but note CMake has some restrictions around this functionality.
- `COMPONENT_OWNBUILDTARGET` & `COMPONENT_OWNCLEANTARGET`: Use CMake ExternalProject instead. See Fully Overriding the Component Build Process for full details.
- `COMPONENT_CONFIG_ONLY`: Call `idf_component_register` without any arguments instead. See Configuration-Only Components.
- `CFLAGS`, `CPPFLAGS`, `CXXFLAGS`: Use equivalent CMake commands instead. See Controlling Component Compilation.

### No Default Values

Unlike in the legacy Make-based build system, the following have no default values:

- Source directories (`COMPONENT_SRCDIRS` variable in Make, `SRC_DIRS` argument to `idf_component_register` in CMake)
- Include directories (`COMPONENT_ADD_INCLUDEDIRS` variable in Make, `INCLUDE_DIRS` argument to `idf_component_register` in CMake)

### No Longer Necessary

- In the legacy Make-based build system, it is required to also set `COMPONENT_SRCDIRS` if `COMPONENT_SRCS` is set. In CMake, the equivalent is not necessary i.e., specifying `SRC_DIRS` to `idf_component_register` if `SRCS` is also specified (in fact, `SRCS` is ignored if `SRC_DIRS` is specified).

### Flashing from Make

`make flash` and similar targets still work to build and flash. However, project `sdkconfig` no longer specifies serial port and baud rate. Environment variables can be used to override these. See Flashing with Ninja or Make for more details.

### Application Examples

- build_system/wrappers demonstrates how to use a linker feature to redefine or override any public function in both ESP-IDF and the bootloader, allowing modification or extension of a function's default behavior.
- custom_bootloader/bootloader_override demonstrates how to override the second stage bootloader from a regular project, providing a custom bootloader that prints an extra message on startup, with the ability to conditionally override the bootloader based on certain conditions like target-dependency or Kconfig options.
- build_system/cmake/import_lib demonstrates how to import and use third-party libraries using ExternalProject CMake module.
- build_system/cmake/import_prebuilt demonstrates how to import a prebuilt static library into the ESP-IDF build system, build a component with dependencies, and link it to the main component, ultimately outputting the current running partition.
- build_system/cmake/idf_as_lib demonstrates the creation of an application equivalent to hello world application using a custom CMake project.
- build_system/cmake/multi_config demonstrates how to build multiple configurations of a single application from a single codebase, it is useful for creating binaries for multiple similar products.
- build_system/cmake/plugins demonstrates features of the ESP-IDF build system related to link time registration of plugins, allowing you to add multiple implementations of a certain feature without the need to make the application aware of all these implementations.
