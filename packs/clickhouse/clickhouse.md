# ClickHouse

**ClickHouse** is an open-source column-oriented DBMS (columnar database management system) for online analytical processing (OLAP) that allows users to generate analytical reports using SQL queries in real-time. ClickHouse Inc. is headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area with the subsidiary, ClickHouse B.V., based in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

ClickHouse, Inc. was incorporated in San Francisco, California, in September 2021 to commercialize the open-source ClickHouse database. The company was initially funded with US$50 million from Index Ventures and Benchmark Capital, with participation from Yandex N.V. and others. On 28 October 2021, the company announced a US$250 million Series B funding round at a valuation of US$2 billion, led by Coatue Management, Altimeter Capital, and others.

In May 2025, ClickHouse raised US$350 million in a Series C funding round led by Khosla Ventures, with participation from BOND, IVP, Battery Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, and existing investors including Index Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, GIC, Benchmark Capital, Coatue Management, FirstMark Capital, and Nebius Group. The round valued the company at approximately US$6.35 billion and brought total funding to more than US$650 million.

The company continues to build and maintain the open source project in parallel to a cloud-based offering.

## History

ClickHouse’s technology was first developed at Yandex, Russia's largest technology company. In 2009, Alexey Milovidov and developers started an experimental project to check the hypothesis if it was viable to generate analytical reports in real-time from non-aggregated data that is also constantly added in real-time. The developers spent 3 years to prove this hypothesis, and in 2012 ClickHouse launched in production for the first time to power Yandex.Metrica.

In 2016, the ClickHouse project was released as open-source software under the Apache 2 license to power analytical use cases around the globe. The systems at the time offered a server throughput of a hundred thousand rows per second, while ClickHouse provided a throughput of hundreds of millions of rows per second.

Since ClickHouse became available as open source in 2016, its popularity has grown, as evidenced through adoption by industry-leading companies like Uber, Comcast, eBay, and Cisco. ClickHouse was also implemented at CERN's LHCb experiment to store and process metadata on 10 billion events with over 1000 attributes per event.
