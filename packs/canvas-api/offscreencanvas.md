# OffscreenCanvas

Baseline

Widely available

*

This feature is well established and works across many devices and browser versions. It’s been available across browsers since March 2023.

* Some parts of this feature may have varying levels of support.

**Note:** This feature is available in Web Workers.

When using the `<canvas>` element or the Canvas API, rendering, animation, and user interaction usually happen on the main execution thread of a web application. The computation relating to canvas animations and rendering can have a significant impact on application performance.

The **`OffscreenCanvas`** interface provides a canvas that can be rendered off screen, decoupling the DOM and the Canvas API so that the `<canvas>` element is no longer entirely dependent on the DOM. Rendering operations can also be run inside a worker context, allowing you to run some tasks in a separate thread and avoid heavy work on the main thread.

`OffscreenCanvas` is a transferable object.

## Constructors

**`OffscreenCanvas()`**

`OffscreenCanvas` constructor. Creates a new `OffscreenCanvas` object.

## Instance properties

**`OffscreenCanvas.height`**

The height of the offscreen canvas.

**`OffscreenCanvas.width`**

The width of the offscreen canvas.

## Instance methods

**`OffscreenCanvas.getContext()`**

Returns a drawing context for the offscreen canvas, or `null` if the context identifier is not supported, or the offscreen canvas has already been set to a different context mode.

**`OffscreenCanvas.convertToBlob()`**

Creates a `Blob` object representing the image contained in the canvas.

**`OffscreenCanvas.transferToImageBitmap()`**

Creates an `ImageBitmap` object from the most recently rendered image of the `OffscreenCanvas`. See its reference for important notes on managing this `ImageBitmap`.

## Events

*Inherits events from its parent, `EventTarget`.*

Listen to these events using `addEventListener()` or by assigning an event listener to the `oneventname` property of this interface.

**`contextlost`**

Fired if the browser detects that an `OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2D` context is lost.

**`contextrestored`**

Fired if the browser successfully restores an `OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2D` context.

## Examples

### Synchronous display of frames produced by an `OffscreenCanvas`

One way to use the `OffscreenCanvas` API is to use a rendering context that has been obtained from an `OffscreenCanvas` object to generate new frames. Once a new frame has finished rendering in this context, the `transferToImageBitmap()` method can be called to save the most recent rendered image. This method returns an `ImageBitmap` object, which can be used in a variety of Web APIs and also in a second canvas without creating a transfer copy.

To display the `ImageBitmap`, you can use an `ImageBitmapRenderingContext` context, which can be created by calling `canvas.getContext("bitmaprenderer")` on a (visible) canvas element. This context only provides functionality to replace the canvas's contents with the given `ImageBitmap`. A call to `ImageBitmapRenderingContext.transferFromImageBitmap()` with the previously rendered and saved `ImageBitmap` from the OffscreenCanvas, will display the `ImageBitmap` on the canvas and transfer its ownership to the canvas. A single `OffscreenCanvas` may transfer frames into an arbitrary number of other `ImageBitmapRenderingContext` objects.

Given these two `<canvas>` elements

```html
<canvas id="one"></canvas> <canvas id="two"></canvas>
```

the following code will provide the rendering using `OffscreenCanvas` as described above.

```js
const one = document.getElementById("one").getContext("bitmaprenderer");
const two = document.getElementById("two").getContext("bitmaprenderer");

const offscreen = new OffscreenCanvas(256, 256);
const gl = offscreen.getContext("webgl");

// Perform some drawing for the first canvas using the gl context
const bitmapOne = offscreen.transferToImageBitmap();
one.transferFromImageBitmap(bitmapOne);

// Perform some more drawing for the second canvas
const bitmapTwo = offscreen.transferToImageBitmap();
two.transferFromImageBitmap(bitmapTwo);
```

### Asynchronous display of frames produced by an `OffscreenCanvas`

Another way to use the `OffscreenCanvas` API, is to call `transferControlToOffscreen()` on a `<canvas>` element, either on a worker or the main thread, which will return an `OffscreenCanvas` object from an `HTMLCanvasElement` object from the main thread. Calling `getContext()` will then obtain a rendering context from that `OffscreenCanvas`.

The `main.js` script (main thread) may look like this:

```js
const htmlCanvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
const offscreen = htmlCanvas.transferControlToOffscreen();

const worker = new Worker("offscreen-canvas.js");
worker.postMessage({ canvas: offscreen }, [offscreen]);
```

While the `offscreen-canvas.js` script (worker thread) can look like this:

```js
onmessage = (evt) => {
  const canvas = evt.data.canvas;
  const gl = canvas.getContext("webgl");
  // Perform some drawing using the gl context
};
```

It's also possible to use `requestAnimationFrame()` in workers:

```js
onmessage = (evt) => {
  const canvas = evt.data.canvas;
  const gl = canvas.getContext("webgl");

  function render(time) {
    // Perform some drawing using the gl context
    requestAnimationFrame(render);
  }
  requestAnimationFrame(render);
};
```
